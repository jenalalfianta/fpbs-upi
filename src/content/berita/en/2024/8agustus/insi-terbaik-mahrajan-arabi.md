**Bandung, August 2, 2024** — Insi Mardiyyah, a student of the Arabic Language Education Program at UPI, was honored as the Best National Participant at *Mahrajan Arabi*, an event organized by Markaz Arabiyyah on August 2, 2024.

The competition served as a forum for Arab cultural expression through art, speeches, and poetry. Insi excelled in reciting classical Arabic poetry with precise intonation, deep emotional expression, and strong interpretation of meaning.

Her mentor, Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd., stated that this achievement is the result of consistent practice and Insi’s deep love for Arabic literature.

*Mahrajan Arabi* is one of the key events that support the development of students' linguistic and literary competence in Arabic. Insi’s success serves as an inspiration for her peers to actively participate in similar activities.
