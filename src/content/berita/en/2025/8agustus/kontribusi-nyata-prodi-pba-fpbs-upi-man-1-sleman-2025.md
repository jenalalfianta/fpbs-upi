Sleman, August 14, 2025 – The community service activity organized by the Arabic Language Education Study Program, FPBS UPI, at MAN 1 Sleman had a positive impact on the development of Arabic language learning. Through a seminar themed *“Wise Use of Technology in Arabic Language Learning Based on Nusantara Culture and Character Education”*, the program successfully introduced a more contextual, creative, and meaningful learning model for both students and teachers.  

The integration of Nusantara cultural values with character education proved effective in increasing students’ motivation to learn and their academic competence. Furthermore, this activity fostered awareness of the importance of preserving local culture while strengthening national identity in the educational process.  

### Impact and Outcomes
The impact of the activity was evident at various levels. At the individual level, students showed high enthusiasm and became more active in learning, as reflected in improved learning outcomes and classroom participation. Teachers gained new experiences that enriched their pedagogical strategies, while students of the Arabic Language Education Study Program had the opportunity to hone their skills through direct field practice.  

At the institutional level, the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between MAN 1 Sleman and the Arabic Language Education Study Program FPBS UPI became an important milestone to ensure the sustainability of collaboration, particularly in the areas of education, community service, and student affairs.  

### Challenges and Opportunities
Although facing challenges such as limited time, facilities, and the need to adapt the curriculum to a cultural approach, the potential for future development is considered significant. The learning model piloted at MAN 1 Sleman has the potential to be replicated in other madrasahs, both in Yogyakarta and in other regions of Indonesia. With the support of research, scientific publications, and institutional commitment, this approach could even become a national prototype for Arabic language learning based on Nusantara culture and character.  

### Aligned with the SDGs
Overall, this community service activity not only enhanced the quality of Arabic language learning but also strengthened cultural values and character education. The program is in line with the vision of national education in preparing young generations who are linguistically competent, of strong character, and firmly rooted in national identity.
