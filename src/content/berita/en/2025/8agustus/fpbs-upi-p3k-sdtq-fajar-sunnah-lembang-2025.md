**Lembang, August 28, 2025** — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) of **Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI)** officially assigned participants of the **Professional Education Strengthening Program (P3K)** from the **Arabic Language Education Study Program** to **SDTQ Fajar Sunnah Lembang.** This activity is part of UPI’s efforts to strengthen students’ professional competence while contributing to the improvement of basic education quality through partnerships between universities and schools.  

The handover ceremony took place on **Wednesday (August 28)** at the SDTQ Fajar Sunnah Lembang campus, West Bandung Regency. The handover was carried out by **Field Supervisor (DPL) Hikmah Maulani, M.Pd.,** representing FPBS UPI, to the **Principal of SDTQ Fajar Sunnah Lembang,** witnessed by program participants and school representatives.  

This year’s P3K program involved **five students**: **Andhika Mulia Daulay, Muhammad Hariri, Irfan Muhammad Shalahuddin, Mochamad Raffly Havidz Ganny,** and **Muhammad Zarkasyi Syafi’i.** The program runs for **three months,** from September to December 2025, as part of the implementation of the **Tri Dharma of Higher Education,** particularly in the area of community service through education.  

Throughout the program, students will participate in various educational activities, including **Arabic language teaching, classroom administration,** and **the development of learning materials** aligned with value-based curricula. This collaboration serves as a contextual learning platform for students while providing tangible contributions to partner schools.  

**Field Supervisor Hikmah Maulani, M.Pd.,** stated that the P3K program serves as a medium for students to apply academic competence in real educational practice.  
> “Through this program, students not only gain direct teaching experience but also learn to understand the dynamics of the elementary school environment. We hope this experience shapes competent, adaptive future educators ready to contribute to national education,” she said.  

Meanwhile, the **Principal of SDTQ Fajar Sunnah Lembang** expressed appreciation for the collaboration with FPBS UPI. The presence of P3K students, she noted, enriches the learning process, especially in strengthening Arabic language instruction as an essential part of Islamic character education at the school.  

The P3K program also supports **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education,** emphasizing equitable access to learning and capacity building for educators at the primary level.  

Through this initiative, FPBS UPI and SDTQ Fajar Sunnah Lembang hope to establish **sustainable synergy** in producing professional educators with a global outlook who are ready to face the challenges of modern education.
