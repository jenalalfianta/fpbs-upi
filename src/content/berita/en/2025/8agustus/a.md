ICOLLITE 9 Highlights Digital Transformation Issues and Encourages Academic Contribution to the SDGs

Bandung, August 6, 2025 — The annual international conference ICOLLITE (International Conference on Language, Literature, Culture, and Education) was once again held by the Faculty of Language and Literature Education, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) on Wednesday, August 6, 2025. Carrying the theme “Digital Transformation in Language, Literature, Culture, and Education,” the 9th ICOLLITE emphasized the role of academia in supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the areas of quality education, equal access to technology, preservation of local culture, and global collaboration.

The conference was attended by hundreds of academics from various countries, both in person and online. They engaged in discussions, presented research, and formulated strategies to address the challenges of the 21st century through interdisciplinary approaches. In various sessions, participants highlighted how digital transformation plays a crucial role in realizing inclusive and quality education (SDG 4). Innovations in digital learning media, language learning technology (CALL/MALL), and online assessments were seen as solutions to improve teaching quality, especially in areas with limited access.

“Many research papers presented at ICOLLITE emphasize the importance of digital literacy, learner autonomy, and curriculum development that is responsive to the needs of the 21st century,” said one participant from Singapore.

In addition to education, ICOLLITE also served as an important platform for discussing the preservation of local languages and cultural values in the context of urbanization and globalization. Studies on folklore, children’s literature, etymology, and local media studies made tangible contributions to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 16 (inclusive and peaceful societies) through strengthening local identity and social harmony.

“Preserving cultural heritage through literature and language is not mere academic romanticism, but part of the effort to create a just and sustainable society,” said a presenter from Thailand.

ICOLLITE also strengthened global partnerships among educational and research institutions (SDG 17). Through this forum, several universities agreed on plans for joint research collaborations and international publications.

Ahmad Fuadin, the ICOLLITE 9 Public Relations Officer, stated that the conference was proof that the academic world can and must actively engage in advancing the global agenda.  
“We believe that research and cross-disciplinary as well as cross-country collaboration are tangible contributions of higher education to sustainable development,” said Ahmad Fuadin.

Unlike many other academic conferences, ICOLLITE emphasized the importance of post-conference follow-up through scientific publications, research dissemination, and training programs. The key message was clear: digital transformation is not only about technology, but also about values, equity, and sustainability. By integrating SDG values into its scientific agenda, ICOLLITE positions UPI and Indonesia as active players in global efforts to create a smarter, fairer, and more sustainable future.
