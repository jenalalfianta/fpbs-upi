Bandung, November 8, 2025 - The Korean Language Education Study Program, together with the Korean Language Education Student Association (HIMABARA) of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), successfully held the 7th *Korean Festival 2025*.  

This event not only marked the largest annual celebration of HIMABARA but also formed part of the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Korean Language Education Study Program and the 71st Dies Natalis of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. Carrying the theme *“Press X to Celebrate”*, the symbol “X” represents the number 10 — signifying a decade of dedication and growth of the program in the field of Korean language, culture, and education in Indonesia.  

The event began with remarks from the Head of the Korean Language Education Study Program, Mrs. Risa Triarisanti, S.Pd., M.Pd., followed by an official opening by Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd., Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Quality Assurance of FPBS UPI, representing UPI Rector Prof. Dr. Didi Sukyadi, M.A. In her speech, she expressed deep appreciation to HIMABARA for its consistency and commitment in organizing an event that not only carries academic value but also strengthens cultural ties between Indonesia and Korea.  

The festival continued with a seminar titled *“Public Diplomacy, Education, and Scholarship in Korea”* delivered by Mr. Kang Won Joon, Counselor General of the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Indonesia. The session provided valuable insights into public diplomacy and educational opportunities in South Korea and was moderated by Mr. Arif Husein Lubis, S.Pd., M.Pd., lecturer of the Korean Language Education Study Program at FPBS UPI.  

The atmosphere grew livelier with the participation of more than 300 attendees who filled the venue with enthusiasm. A series of performances featured guest stars including Noraeboy, Dinda Trisiana (an accomplished alumna of the Korean Language Education Study Program FPBS UPI), and the cover dance group SOJU. Winners of the pre-event *Cover Dance* and *Cover Sing* competitions also performed impressively on the main stage.  

Through *Korean Festival 2025*, the Korean Language Education Study Program and HIMABARA reaffirmed their commitment to fostering creativity, cultural appreciation, and academic excellence among students, while strengthening academic and cultural collaboration between Indonesia and Korea. The event also served as a reflection and celebration of the 10-year journey of the Korean Language Education Study Program FPBS UPI, which continues to innovate toward realizing UPI’s vision of “Gemilang untuk Indonesia dan Dunia” (*Excellence for Indonesia and the World*).  

Aligned with the spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 4 (Quality Education) and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), the event contributes to expanding access to intercultural education and building global collaboration between Indonesia and Korea through educational and cultural diplomacy.
