**Bandung, March 15, 2025** â€” Insi Mardiyyah, a student of the Arabic Language Education Program at UPI, earned 3rd Place at the national level in the STIU DQ Festival, organized by STIU Darul Quran on March 15, 2025.

The festival emphasized the ability to read and interpret Arabic texts, including *qira'ah* (recitation), *tarjimah* (translation), and *tafsir* (interpretation). Insi demonstrated her competence in understanding the syntactic structures and deep meanings of classical Arabic texts.

Under the guidance of Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd., Insi underwent intensive training in reading and interpreting high-level (*fusha*) Arabic texts, along with recitation practices focusing on proper *tajwid* and rhythm.

This achievement further strengthens the reputation of the Arabic Language Education Program at UPI as a department that prioritizes not only theoretical knowledge but also practical engagement and active student participation in national linguistic and academic forums.
