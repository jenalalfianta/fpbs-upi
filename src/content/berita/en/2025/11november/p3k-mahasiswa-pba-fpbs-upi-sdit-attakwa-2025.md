Bandung, November 20, 2025 — Students of the Arabic Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), have commenced the implementation of the Professional Education Experience Strengthening Program (P3K) at SDIT Attakwa KPAD Bandung. This activity serves as part of the implementation of the Higher Education Tridharma, while simultaneously strengthening collaboration between UPI and partner schools in enhancing the quality of elementary education.

Throughout the program, students are engaged not only in observation but also in various instructional activities. They participate in designing lesson plans, delivering material, managing classrooms, conducting formative assessments, and providing individual assistance to students. All activities are supervised by mentor teachers and academic supervisors to ensure alignment with the basic competency standards of elementary education.

In addition to academic engagement, P3K students also take part in religious habituation programs that characterize SDIT Attakwa. They assist students during morning Qur’an recitation, dhuha prayer, short sermons, and the guidance of short surah memorization. This involvement provides practical experience in integrating religious values into the educational process, while also offering varied character-building approaches for students.

In the area of school management, students gain additional experience through involvement in administrative processes. They assist in managing student data, preparing activity reports, documenting school activities, and supporting extracurricular and personal development programs. These activities offer students a deeper understanding of professional and effective elementary school governance.

The implementation of P3K at SDIT Attakwa also supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education. The presence of students contributes to a more collaborative and innovative learning environment and strengthens the spiritual, social, and academic values within the school community.

UPI and SDIT Attakwa expressed optimism that this program will strengthen sustainable collaboration in improving the quality of elementary education. Students gain field experience relevant to the competencies required of modern educators, while schools benefit from the presence of energetic and capable future teachers. This synergy is expected to serve as a model of collaboration for other UPI partner schools in the future.
