Bandung, November 20, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (FPBS UPI) successfully held a Book Talk titled “Exploring Kartini’s Voice through the Kartini Trilogy,” authored by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wardiman Djojonegoro, former Minister of Education and Culture of Indonesia (1993–1998). The hybrid event, held at Auditorium B FPBS UPI and via Zoom, was attended by more than 300 participants, including FPBS leadership, professors, lecturers, students, and the general public.

The event was officially opened by FPBS Dean Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D., who highlighted historical literacy and the role of women in education. The book talk was warmly and engagingly moderated by Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, creating an inspiring atmosphere throughout the session.

A special moment emerged during the reading of excerpts from Kartini’s letters by two students: Puan Maharani (Sundanese Language Education) and Maulida Fitriatusyifa (Indonesian Language and Literature). The event was made even livelier by the hosts, Andrian and Icha—students of Indonesian Language and Literature—who guided the program enthusiastically.

The discussion unfolded dynamically, with questions from academics and participants, including Prof. Tutin, Prof. Fuad, Prof. Retty, Pak Buyung, as well as students from various study programs. Their engagement demonstrated the strong interest in the book’s content and its relevance to education, literacy, and literary studies.

The event also included a book-signing session by Prof. Wardiman. On this occasion, he donated the trilogy to UPI Library—received by Dr. Riche Cynthia Johan, M.Si—and to the FPBS Literacy Pavilion—received by the FPBS Dean.

This book talk served as a valuable moment for FPBS UPI’s academic community to reflect on and embody Kartini’s spirit. Beyond that, Kartini’s values must continue to be carried forward through literacy, education, and meaningful contributions in shaping young generations who are critical, creative, and empowered.
