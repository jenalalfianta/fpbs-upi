Bandung, November 7, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), actively participated in the “UPI Berjalan Serempak dan Berdampak” event held to commemorate UPI’s 71st Anniversary. The activity took place at the Bumi Siliwangi Campus and was attended by the entire UPI academic community, including university leadership, lecturers, education staff, and students.

The fun walk promoted a spirit of togetherness and social responsibility, in line with this year’s anniversary theme, “Melesat Bersama untuk UPI Gemilang.” Participants walked together across the campus while engaging in meaningful actions such as maintaining environmental cleanliness, planting trees, and interacting with the surrounding community.

FPBS participated with enthusiasm and unity through the involvement of faculty leaders, lecturers, education staff, and students from various study programs. Beyond demonstrating togetherness, the event also served as a moment to strengthen solidarity among the UPI community and reaffirm FPBS’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Dean of FPBS UPI, Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D., stated that FPBS’s participation in this activity reflects the faculty’s commitment to fostering a healthy, inclusive, and empowered academic environment. “Through this event, FPBS aims to continue nurturing a culture of healthy living, collaboration, and environmental awareness. Walking together is not only a symbol of unity but also a concrete step toward building a sustainable campus,” he said.

The event concluded with entertainment sessions and the presentation of awards to the best-performing units in various competition categories throughout the anniversary series.
