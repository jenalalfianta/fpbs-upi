Bandung, October 19, 2025 — The Korean Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), once again demonstrated its dedication and contribution to the development of foreign language education in Indonesia through the successful organization of the 102nd Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK) PBT. The event took place on October 19, 2025, at the FPBS UPI Building in Bandung and was attended by hundreds of participants from various regions across Indonesia who share a strong interest in the Korean language and culture.

The implementation of the 102nd TOPIK serves as a tangible contribution of UPI as a pioneering and globally leading university. Through this event, the Korean Language Education Study Program of FPBS UPI plays an active role in providing access for Indonesians to assess their Korean language proficiency at an international level. This initiative also reflects UPI’s commitment to improving the quality of foreign language education and strengthening academic collaboration between Indonesia and South Korea.

A total of 643 participants took part in the 102nd TOPIK, consisting of 242 participants for TOPIK I and 401 participants for TOPIK II. This number demonstrates the high enthusiasm of the public toward Korean language learning, as well as their trust in UPI as a credible, professional, and internationally standardized TOPIK test organizer. This achievement was made possible through strong collaboration among lecturers, educational staff, students, and other supporting parties who ensured the event ran smoothly, orderly, and in accordance with procedures.

Beyond language assessment, the event also served as a platform to strengthen bilateral relations in education between Indonesia and South Korea. Through the consistent organization of TOPIK, UPI contributes to fostering intercultural understanding and expanding opportunities for Indonesian students to pursue further studies or careers related to Korean language and culture.

The event aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4: Quality Education, which emphasizes the importance of inclusive and equitable learning opportunities for all. Furthermore, the 102nd TOPIK also supports SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, as it involves cooperation between educational institutions in Indonesia and South Korea to build mutually beneficial academic and cultural bridges.

By successfully organizing the 102nd TOPIK, the Korean Language Education Study Program of FPBS UPI reaffirms its strategic role in expanding access to Korean language education in Indonesia. Through this initiative, FPBS and UPI continue their commitment to making meaningful contributions to improving education quality, strengthening global competence, and achieving the university’s vision as an impactful and internationally competitive institution.
