**Bandung, July 9, 2025**  
Three students from the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), have made remarkable achievements in the **2025 Sookmyung UNESCO UNITWIN Women in Digital and Entrepreneurship Training (WiDE)** program. Out of 17 FPBS participants, three were selected among the two best teams that will continue the training in South Korea.

The program ran in a hybrid format from June 24 to July 7, 2025, and concluded with a **Closing Ceremony** held on Monday, July 7, 2025, at the PPPG Building Auditorium and via Zoom. This initiative is a collaboration between UPI, Sookmyung Women’s University, and UNESCO UNITWIN, supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea.

### Selected Team – *Digital Training on Data Analysis and Visualization*
- **Dinda Novi Nurjanah** (BA in English Language and Literature, FPBS)  
- **Tazkia Aulia Nurkhaerani** (FPTI)  
- **Khoirotun Hisan** (UPI Tasikmalaya)  
- **Rifda Ferry Risnifa** (FPSD)

This team developed two Python-based simulation projects:  
1. **Viral Tweet Simulation** – simulates the spread of tweets on X (formerly Twitter) and analyzes the likelihood of tweets going viral based on retweet probability.  
2. **Gender Bias in Recruitment** – simulates neutral vs. biased recruitment systems to illustrate how gender bias affects women's chances of getting hired in the tech industry.

> “As an English literature student, I found it quite challenging to learn Python at first,” Dinda admitted. “But it turned out to be a valuable experience. I’m grateful for the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and learn something meaningful in today’s digital era.”  
>  
> “When our team was announced as one of the winners, we were shocked and moved. It’s truly unforgettable,” she added.

### Selected Team – *Entrepreneurial Leadership Training*
- **Siti Nurhasanah** (BA in English Education, FPBS)  
- **Dwi Aulia Nisa** (BA in English Education, FPBS)  
- **Kinandhita Nasywa Savana** (FIP)  
- **Rasya Azlina Hastarini** (FIP)

Their project, **“Soilution: Empowering Farmers with IoT for Healthier Soil, Stronger Crops, and Better Harvest”**, integrates IoT technology to help farmers manage soil fertility digitally.

> “I don’t have a business background, but the training was structured from the basics, so it was easy to follow,” said Siti.  
> “We learned to build our business ideas from scratch and pitch them in front of experts. Being selected to go to South Korea feels like a dream come true.”

The selection of three FPBS students as delegates to South Korea reflects not only their **global competitiveness**, but also FPBS's strong commitment to supporting student potential across disciplines—particularly in **technology and entrepreneurship**.

This accomplishment also aligns with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly **Goal 5: Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls**. By mastering digital tools and entrepreneurial leadership, these students have become part of a **global movement encouraging women to lead and excel in the digital era**.
