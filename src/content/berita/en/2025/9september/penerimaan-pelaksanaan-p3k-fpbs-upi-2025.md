Bandung, September 19, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia has established a collaboration with MTs Ar-Rohmah Bandung for the implementation of the Professional Education Experience Strengthening Program (P3K). This collaboration supports the realization of the Three Pillars of Higher Education (Tridharma Perguruan Tinggi) and contributes to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education.

The signing ceremony of the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Cooperation Agreement (PKS) took place on Friday, September 19, 2025. The documents were signed by the Principal of MTs Ar-Rohmah, Mohamad Nurjaman, M.Pd., and Vice Principal for Curriculum Affairs, Intan Putri Pratiwi, M.Pd., together with the Dean of FPBS UPI, Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D.

Through this agreement, both institutions officially confirmed the implementation of the P3K Program at MTs Ar-Rohmah for the 2025/2026 academic year. The five-month program provides students with firsthand experience in the madrasah environment, allowing them to develop teaching skills, classroom and school administrative management, and other essential professional competencies.

The study programs within FPBS emphasized that the implementation of P3K represents a concrete realization of the Tridharma Perguruan Tinggi, particularly in the areas of education, research, and community service.

UPI and MTs Ar-Rohmah expressed optimism in building a sustainable partnership. This collaboration is expected to contribute significantly to improving education quality at the madrasah tsanawiyah level while enriching students’ learning experiences and strengthening institutional networks.
