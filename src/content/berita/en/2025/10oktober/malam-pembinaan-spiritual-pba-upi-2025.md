Bandung, October 31, 2025 — The **Arabic Language Education Study Program (PBA)** of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) organized its first **Spiritual Development Night** at the Al-Furqan Mosque, UPI, on October 30–31, 2025. The event was attended by dozens of new PBA students and facilitated by students from the 2022–2024 cohorts as part of character building and spiritual strengthening at the beginning of their academic journey.

The event was officially opened by the Head of the PBA Study Program, **Dr. Asep Sopian, M.Ag.**, who also accompanied the participants throughout the entire program until the closing session. In his remarks, Dr. Asep emphasized the importance of balancing worldly and spiritual aspects in students’ lives.  
“This spiritual night is the first to be held at the study program level. Its purpose is to remind us all that the goal of life is not only to pursue worldly matters but also spiritual ones. It is not only the body and mind that need nourishment; the soul must also be nurtured with faith and devotion,” he conveyed before the participants.

Also present was the Secretary of the PBA Study Program, **Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd.**, who fully supported this initiative for new student development. He stated that such activities play an important role in shaping the identity of PBA students as future educators with noble character and integrity.  
The event began with a **recitation of Al-Qur’an Juz 29–30 (tasmi’)** before the **ifthar jama’i (communal breaking of the fast)**. Following the meal, participants attended an **Islamic lecture titled “Life Goals: Do Good Deeds, Not Just for Going Viral”** delivered by **Farhan Fuadi, M.Pd.**, who invited students to reflect on the meaning of good deeds amidst today’s digital culture, which often emphasizes self-image.

Later in the evening, participants performed **qiyamul lail (night prayer)** led directly by Dr. Asep Sopian. Before the closing ceremony, selected participants once again recited portions of the Qur’an as a symbol of devotion and love for the holy text. The event concluded with a group reflection and a photo session inside the Al-Furqan Mosque.

For many new students, the activity was a memorable spiritual experience. **Kustia**, one of the participants, shared her gratitude:  
“Alhamdulillah, this activity helped me get closer to Allah and also to my fellow classmates. For those who had never joined a mabit before, it was a meaningful experience to spend the night in such an activity,” she said.  
Meanwhile, **Nasywa**, another participant, expressed her hope that the spiritual enthusiasm from this event would continue beyond the program:  
“It was truly memorable. I hope we can all remain steadfast afterward,” she added.

This **Spiritual Development Night** reflects PBA UPI’s commitment to providing education that goes beyond intellectual growth by nurturing students’ moral and spiritual dimensions. This initiative also aligns with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly **Goal 4 (Quality Education)** and **Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)**, emphasizing the importance of value-based education in shaping knowledgeable, ethical, and socially responsible youth who contribute to peace and societal progress.
