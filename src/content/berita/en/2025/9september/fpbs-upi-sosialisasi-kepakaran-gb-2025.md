The event was also attended by several high-ranking university and faculty officials, including the Chair of the UPI Professorial Council, **Prof. Dr. Dadang Sunendar, M.Hum.,** Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Quality Assurance, **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd.,** Vice Dean for Student Affairs and Partnerships, **Yanty Wirza, M.A., Ph.D.,** **Prof. Dr. Syihabuddin, M.Pd.,** section heads, lecturers, and students of FPBS.  

In his presentation entitled *"الأسلوبية التربوية في تعلم اللغة العربية متعدد الثقافات"* (*Pedagogical Stylistics in Multicultural Arabic Language Learning*), **Dr. Asep Sopian, M.Ag.** elaborated on his expertise in Arabic Stylistics Teaching. He explained that Pedagogical Stylistics applies stylistic analysis in teaching with the aim of enhancing motivation, improving understanding of literature and language, and enriching students’ language acquisition. This approach integrates linguistic and literary studies with pedagogical methods through systematic stylistic analysis.  

He also introduced the **5 Levels of Stylistic Analysis** (*Mustawa Shauti, Sharfi, Nahwi, Dalali, and Tashhawwuri*), which include learning activities such as comparing stylistic devices, answering critical questions, group discussions, elaboration, analysis, creative writing, and stylistic interpretation. Furthermore, he emphasized the significance of the **multicultural dimension** in Arabic language education through *content integration, knowledge construction process, prejudice reduction, equity pedagogy,* and *empowering school culture & social structure.*  

The presence of faculty and university leaders demonstrated strong institutional support for lecturer expertise development. **Prof. Dr. Dadang Sunendar, M.Hum.,** as Chair of the Professorial Council, expressed appreciation for Dr. Asep Sopian’s insightful presentation, noting its valuable contribution to the field of Arabic Stylistics Teaching.  

The hybrid event drew high enthusiasm from both onsite and online participants. Lecturers and students responded positively to the Pedagogical Stylistics approach, especially regarding its relevance to the contextual and multicultural needs of Arabic language learning.  

With the introduction of this innovative approach, Arabic language learning in Indonesia is expected to become more contextual, innovative, and inclusive, accommodating cultural diversity among students while retaining the religious values that characterize Arabic education.  

This expertise socialization represents one of FPBS UPI’s strategic steps in strengthening its position as a leading higher education institution in developing innovative and sustainable methodologies for language and literature learning.
