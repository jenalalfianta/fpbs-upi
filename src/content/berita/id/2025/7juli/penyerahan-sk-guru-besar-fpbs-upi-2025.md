**Bandung, July 21, 2025** – In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious and Most Merciful, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) held the presentation of Professor Decrees to five lecturers from various faculties, as formal recognition of the highest academic achievement in higher education. Two of the recipients were from the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), UPI.

The decree presentation took place on Monday, July 21, 2025, at 10:30 a.m. WIB at the Partere Building, UPI. The symbolic presentation was delivered by the Vice Rector for Finance, Human Resources, and General Administration, Prof. Dr. Adang Suherman, M.A., representing the UPI Rector who was unable to attend in person.

The two FPBS lecturers receiving the Professor Decrees were:
- Dr. Gin Gin Gustine, M.Pd., Ph.D., appointed as Professor in the field of Language and Literacy Education  
- Dr. Ika Lestari Damayanti, M.A., Ph.D., appointed as Professor in the field of English Literacy Education

With this addition, the total number of Professors at UPI has reached 236, consisting of 215 from the Diktisaintek pathway and 21 appointed through Rector’s Decree due to holding NIDK status.

In his remarks, Prof. Adang emphasized that the title of Professor is not merely an individual academic achievement, but a mandate that must be carried out with intellectual and social responsibility.

The UPI Rector also attended the event virtually via Zoom Meeting, making the presentation a hybrid (offline and online) ceremony. He stated that the title of Professor is not just an academic accomplishment but a great responsibility to nurture and advance future generations.

He underlined that Professors are expected to actively guide students from undergraduate to doctoral levels and encourage them to complete their studies through scientific publication. “Undergraduate and Master’s students should aim to publish in SINTA-accredited journals, while doctoral students are targeted to publish in reputable international journals such as Scopus,” he said.

In line with this, the Chair of the UPI Professors Council, Prof. Dr. Dadang Sunendar, M.Hum., also conveyed his message for Professors to uphold academic integrity and prioritize wisdom in every academic forum. He stressed the importance of fostering a healthy academic climate—open to criticism yet upholding scholarly courtesy.

> “A Professor is not only a symbol of expertise but also the guardian of UPI’s academic dignity. Be a thought leader who brings benefits not only through writing but also through actions and mentorship,” urged Prof. Dadang.

The Dean of FPBS, Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd., expressed her gratitude for the issuance of the Professor Decrees for the two FPBS lecturers. “This is both a blessing and a mandate. Hopefully, this academic recognition will further strengthen FPBS’s contribution in delivering inclusive, progressive language and literature education with real impact on society,” she stated.

She added that this achievement aligns with the values of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 4 (Quality Education), Goal 5 (Gender Equality), and Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions). “We want this knowledge to extend beyond academic spaces—to be shared, grounded in reality, and to bring benefit for the happiness and well-being of humankind,” she added.

Closing the event, Prof. Adang shared a warm and reflective spiritual message:

> “We begin by mentioning the name of Allah, and when we succeed, let us not forget to say Alhamdulillah. Let us continue to do good through the profession we pursue.”
