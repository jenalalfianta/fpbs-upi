Subang — The Student Executive Board of the Arabic Language Education Student Association (BEM KEMABA) once again successfully held its final cadre formation activity, "Daurah Asāsiyyah al-Tsālitsah," at Gili Gili Camp, Subang Regency. The event, held on October 25–26, 2025, fostered a warm, collaborative, and family-like atmosphere.

The main goal of this activity was to develop KEMABA cadres capable of applying leadership concepts, solving both personal and group challenges, and building togetherness as a foundation for creating a solid teamwork culture in the pursuit of goodness.

The event was officially opened in a solemn and meaningful atmosphere by the Student Advisor and the Head of the Arabic Language Education Study Program. In their remarks, they emphasized the importance of cadre formation as a process of character building, discipline, and preparation for students in both organization and academic life. They also warmly welcomed the new students as integral members of KEMABA.

Following the opening, the series of activities continued with various engaging programs that encouraged cooperation and creativity. Participants were divided into several groups to take part in a Cooking Competition, testing their teamwork and innovation. The excitement continued with fun games filled with laughter and unity.

The activities also included congregational prayers at each prayer time as a form of spiritual practice amidst the busy schedule. Afterward, participants resumed activities with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

The evening’s highlight was the Campfire and Art Performance, where each group showcased their talents, creating a warm and reflective atmosphere. The winners of the various competitions were then announced.

Later that night, the main cadre formation activity, Post to Post, took place. Each post was led by representatives from KEMABA’s divisions and institutions. Through this activity, participants were given challenges by each division or body within KEMABA. The participants’ enthusiasm was evident throughout the lively and spirited event.

The following morning began with a Morning Exercise session to refresh and energize participants. It was followed by the second Post to Post session, featuring representatives from all active student cohorts and alumni. This session provided valuable opportunities for new students to receive motivation, share experiences, and strengthen bonds with seniors and alumni.

As the closing highlight, a formal Induction Ceremony was held to inaugurate the new students as official members of the Arabic Language Student Association. This moment marked the culmination of Daurah Asāsiyyah al-Tsālitsah, symbolizing the beginning of the new students’ journey to contribute actively to the association and the Arabic Language Education Study Program.

The event concluded with a group documentation session featuring all participants and committee members, filled with smiles and gratitude for the success of the event. After the series of activities ended, everyone packed up and safely returned to Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia.
