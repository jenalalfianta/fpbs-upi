**Bandung, July 18, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia welcomed an academic visit from the Graduate School of Universitas Terbuka (UT), South Tangerang City, for the signing of a Cooperation Agreement (PKS). The event took place on Friday, July 18, 2025, from 09.00 to 15.00 WIB at the FPBS UPI campus.

The collaboration focuses on improving the quality and governance of the Master’s Program in English Language Education at UT Bandung Graduate School. One of the main agendas of the event was a benchmarking session on the university's three pillars (tridharma), as well as the exploration of good practices in implementing the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) system.

The agreement was signed directly by the Director of the UT Graduate School, South Tangerang City, marking the beginning of formal collaboration between the two institutions. The UT delegation was welcomed by FPBS leadership, including Prof. Yulianeta, M.Pd. (Vice Dean for Academic Affairs), Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D. (Vice Dean for Finance, Human Resources, and General Affairs), and Prof. Emi Emilia, Ph.D. (Head of the Master’s Program in English Language Education).

Through this forum, both institutions expressed their commitment to strengthening academic governance, professional development of lecturers, and the design of outcome-based curricula. This initiative also opens opportunities for knowledge exchange and best practices in higher education management.

Moreover, this collaboration aligns with the global vision of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
- **Goal 4 – Quality Education**, ensuring inclusive, equitable, and high-quality higher education for all;
- **Goal 17 – Partnerships for the Goals**, by strengthening institutional cooperation among educational institutions to enhance institutional capacity.

This event is expected to be the beginning of a broader collaboration between FPBS UPI and Universitas Terbuka, contributing to improved quality, inclusivity, and competitiveness of postgraduate programs in Indonesia at both national and global levels.
