**French Education Study Program UPI Participates in École d'Été Erasmus+ Summer School Program in Luang Prabang and Vientiane, Laos**

École d'Été, or Summer School, is a collaborative program between Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) and Université Savoie Mont Blanc, France. This partnership involves three Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, and Laos. Indonesia is represented by UPI and UNJ, Malaysia by Universiti Malaya (UM) and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaya (UKM), and Laos by the National University of Laos (NUL).

The 2025 École d'Été program was held in Luang Prabang and Vientiane, Laos, from July 21 to 27, 2025. The French Education Study Program participated by sending two students, Rizqia Mishel Mediputri and Nanda Tri Ayu Nurauliarachman, along with two supervising lecturers, Dr. Farida Amalia, M.Pd., and Dr. Yuliarti Mutiarsih, M.Pd.

Students participating in the Summer School or École d'Été will explore culture, tourism, and enhance their French language proficiency. The main goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality of tourism in the three Asian countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, and Laos—through the teaching of French for Tourism.

This activity aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Quality Education and Partnerships for the Goals. It is hoped that the program will contribute to enhancing national education quality and strengthening the tourism sector.
