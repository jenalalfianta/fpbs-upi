Bandung, November 5, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), proudly celebrated the inauguration of two distinguished lecturers from the English Language Education Study Program, Prof. Ika Lestari Damayanti, M.A., Ph.D., and Prof. Gin Gin Gustine, M.Pd., Ph.D., as Professors. Both were among the twelve professors inaugurated by Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia during the 2025 Professorial Inauguration Ceremony held on November 4–5, 2025, at the Achmad Sanusi Building (BPU) UPI.

The solemn ceremony, attended by UPI Rector Prof. Dr. Didi Sukyadi, M.A., vice rectors, deans, and members of the academic community from various faculties, marked FPBS’s continued contribution to advancing the field of language and literacy education in Indonesia.

Prof. Ika Lestari Damayanti, M.A., Ph.D., was inaugurated as Professor in English Language Literacy Education. Her expertise encompasses English for Young Learners (EYL), Reading to Learn Pedagogy, Genre-Based Teaching, and Professional Learning. Through her research and publications, Prof. Ika has made significant contributions to developing approaches to English language education that integrate language, context, and literacy from an early age. She has also been actively involved in designing genre- and literacy-based learning models to enhance students’ reading and writing skills, as well as facilitating teacher professional development through practice-based training and research.

Meanwhile, Prof. Gin Gin Gustine, M.Pd., Ph.D., was inaugurated as Professor in Language and Literacy Education, with a focus on Critical Literacy. His research highlights how language learning can serve as a medium for fostering students’ critical awareness of social, cultural, and ideological issues reflected in texts. Prof. Gin Gin has been actively promoting critical literacy education in Indonesia through research, international publications, and teacher training programs, encouraging English teachers to integrate reflective and analytical values into their teaching practices.

This professorial inauguration not only strengthens the university’s academic reputation but also supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education. It stands as a proud milestone for the faculty and a momentum to further encourage excellent research in language and literacy education. With these two new professors, FPBS UPI continues to solidify its position as a leading center for language, literature, and education studies, contributing to national educational advancement and global academic excellence.
