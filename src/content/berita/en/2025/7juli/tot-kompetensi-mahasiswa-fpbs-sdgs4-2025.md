**Bandung, July 25, 2025** – To enhance lecturers’ capacity in preparing students for the workforce, the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) organized a **Training of Trainers (ToT) on Student Competency Development** on Friday, July 25, 2025, from 08:00 to 11:30 WIB.

The event was attended by 20 young lecturers from 10 study programs at FPBS (two from each), 10 student affairs supervisors, faculty leadership (Dean and three Vice Deans), and featured three speakers: **Tommy Satiadi** (Learning Success Manager at the Wadhwani Foundation), **Dr. Lili Adi Wibowo, S.Pd., S.Sos., MM.**, and **Ratu Dintha Insyani Zukhruf Firdausi Sulaksana, S.Pd., M.M.** from the Faculty of Economics and Business Education (FPEB) UPI.

In the main session, Tommy Satiadi presented a topic titled *Preparing Job-Ready Talent Alumni with Employability Skills*. The presentation highlighted that over 55% of university graduates in Indonesia are considered unprepared for the job market due to a lack of soft skills such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving. The **Wadhwani Foundation**, a global organization focused on job creation, offers a solution through the **JobsReady Employability Skills Program**, which includes 10 training modules, 75 micro-modules, and an AI-based digital platform (GenieAI). The program is entirely free and can be integrated into curricula or student mentoring activities.

ToT participants were introduced to a learning methodology that combines **pre-class (self-learning), in-class (interactive collaboration), and post-class (independent exploration)**, along with video-based simulations and real-world communication practice. The ultimate goal of the program is to equip students with critical thinking, effective communication, job interview readiness, and adaptability to digital industry demands.

This initiative aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education**, particularly **Target 4.4**, which emphasizes improving technical and vocational skills for youth and educators. By equipping young lecturers with new approaches to student mentoring, FPBS UPI demonstrates its commitment to producing graduates who are not only academically excellent but also globally competitive in the workforce.
