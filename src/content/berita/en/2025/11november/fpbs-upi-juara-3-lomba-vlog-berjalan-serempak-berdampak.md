Bandung, 12 November 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) achieved 3rd Place in the “UPI Berjalan Serempak dan Berdampak” Vlog Competition, which was part of the series of events celebrating UPI’s 71st Anniversary.

The competition was participated in by various faculties and work units across UPI with the aim of documenting the spirit of togetherness and meaningful contributions toward realizing a green, healthy, and sustainable campus. The FPBS vlog showcased a unique creative approach by highlighting the theme “UPI Asih, UPI Bersih,” combining educational value, collaborative spirit, and environmental awareness around the campus.

Through a dynamic and cheerful concept, the FPBS team effectively visualized the main message of the activity — that cleanliness, health, and solidarity are integral elements of UPI’s academic community identity.

Dean of FPBS UPI, Prof. Dr. Wawan Gunawan, M.Hum., Ph.D., expressed his appreciation to the creative team for bringing pride to the faculty. “This achievement reflects the spirit of innovation and togetherness that thrives within FPBS. We are proud because this work not only showcases creativity but also embodies the sustainability values emphasized by the university,” he said.

This accomplishment further strengthens FPBS UPI’s commitment to supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), through inspiring activities that positively impact the academic environment.
