Bandung, October 28, 2025 — The Indonesian Language and Literature Education Student Association (HIMA Satrasia), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, successfully organized the 2025 Gebyar Bahasa dan Sastra Indonesia (GBSI) series of events under the theme “Language in Motion: Celebrating Words, Preserving Meaning.” The event took place from October 28–31, 2025, at the UPI Amphitheater Cultural Building and surrounding areas.

GBSI is an annual HIMA Satrasia event that serves as a platform for student expression, collaboration, and literacy in the field of Indonesian language and literature. This year, the event presented a diverse range of programs combining academic, artistic, and cultural elements in one grand celebration of language.

The event began on Tuesday, October 28, 2025, from 12:50–15:00 with an opening ceremony titled “Language in Motion” at the Amphitheater Cultural Building. The opening featured literary performances, remarks from faculty leaders, and a language-themed oration that inspired literacy awareness. On the same day, the “Isola Book Fair” followed from 15:45–18:10, featuring local writers and publishers in an open literary market setting.

From October 28 to 30, 2025, visitors could enjoy the Collaborative Poster Creation Exhibition at the Amphitheater Green Field, showcasing visual artworks themed around language and literature produced by cross-cohort students. One of the most anticipated programs, “Pasar Kata & Rasa” (Market of Words and Flavors), took place from October 28 to 31, 2025, from 08:00–19:00 at the Amphitheater Cultural Building Courtyard. Here, visitors could enjoy local culinary delights and creative student products while attending live music performances and open poetry readings in the “Open Language Space.”

Meanwhile, the iconic Poetry Reading Competition for the Rendra Cup (LBPPR) was held at the Geugeut-Winda PKM Building, 2nd Floor, on October 29–30, 2025, featuring top participants from across Indonesia competing in the semi-final and final rounds.

As the culmination, GBSI 2025 concluded with the “Senja Anugerah” (Evening of Awards) ceremony on Friday, October 31, 2025, from 15:00–21:10 at the Amphitheater Cultural Building UPI. The event served as a moment of appreciation for competition winners and literacy advocates who have contributed to the advancement of Indonesian language and literature.

Zibal Akbar, Chair of HIMA Satrasia FPBS UPI, stated that GBSI is more than just a festival — it is a concrete form of student contribution in enlivening literacy and cultural values. 

> “GBSI is a joyful learning space. We want language and literature not only to be studied but also to be celebrated, felt, and lived together,” he said.

The Head of the Indonesian Language and Literature Education Study Program, Prof. Dr. Sumiyadi, M.Hum., added that GBSI plays an important role in strengthening students’ character and creativity. 

> “Through GBSI, students learn to organize, create, and collaborate across disciplines in a lively literacy atmosphere.”

GBSI 2025 also supports the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly **SDG 4: Quality Education**, by promoting literacy, creativity, and student participation in knowledge-based activities, and **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**, through the preservation of language, literature, and the arts as part of the nation’s cultural identity. With a spirit of collaboration and innovation, GBSI 2025 stands as proof that Indonesian language and literature remain relevant, dynamic, and vibrant both in academic spaces and the broader community.
