**Bandung, May 27, 2025** — Another remarkable achievement was made by Arif Rahman Hakim, a student of the Arabic Language Education Study Program at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). In the national-level LSB Competition organized by UKM LSB of UIN Walisongo Semarang, Arif secured 3rd Place at the national level.

The competition was held on May 27, 2025, just one day before the *"Daur al-Lughah al-‘Arabiyyah”* event, and challenged participants to creatively express their ideas in Arabic through both writing and speaking.

Arif demonstrated his skills with elegant language, well-structured arguments, and a solid mastery of the topic.

His supervisors, Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd., and Dr. Mia Nurmala, M.Pd., expressed their appreciation for this achievement, noting Arif's ability to perform exceptionally well in two national competitions back-to-back.

Arif’s success proves that students from UPI’s Arabic Language Education Program are capable of excelling academically and competing at a national level.
