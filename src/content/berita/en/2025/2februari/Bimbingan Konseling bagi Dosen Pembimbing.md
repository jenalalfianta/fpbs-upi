The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) organized a counseling workshop for academic advisors on 21 February 2025. The event aimed to enhance lecturers' capacity in providing optimal academic guidance and support for students throughout their studies. It was held in a hybrid format—on-site at the FPBS Auditorium and online via Zoom Meeting.

The program began with an opening ceremony and the singing of the Indonesian national anthem. This was followed by a welcoming speech from the Head of BKPK, who emphasized the crucial role of academic advisors in supporting students' academic success. The event was then officially opened by the Dean of FPBS.

Four key speakers were invited to share insightful perspectives:

1. **Prof. Ahmad Yani, M.Pd.** (Head of the Curriculum Division, Directorate of Education) – Presented on the implementation mechanism of UPI’s curriculum and how academic advisors can assist students in adapting to the curriculum.
2. **Dr. Yusi Riksa Yustiana, M.Pd.** (Head of BKPK UPI) – Provided guidance for academic advisors on effective student mentoring, including strategies for monitoring students’ academic progress.
3. **Prof. Dr. Ilfiandra, M.Pd.** (BKPK) – Discussed student academic procrastination and how advisors can help students overcome this habit.
4. **Dr. Sri Maslihah, M.Psi.** (Psychology Lecturer and Psychologist) – Delivered a session on understanding students’ psychological needs to offer appropriate support throughout their academic journey.

Following the presentations, participants engaged in a lively Q&A session, where many lecturers asked questions regarding effective approaches to mentoring students facing academic and psychological challenges.

The event concluded with hopes that academic advisors at FPBS will take a more active role in supporting students' academic success through more structured and effective guidance services. **(Teja Mustika)**
