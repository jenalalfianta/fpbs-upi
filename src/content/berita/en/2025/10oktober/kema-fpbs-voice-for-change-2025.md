**Bandung, October 5, 2025** — The **Student Association (KEMA)** of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (**FPBS UPI**) reaffirmed the university’s role as a **gender-responsive institution** through the seminar **“Voice for Change Vol. 2.”**  
The event, organized by the **Advocacy and Student Welfare Division (Adkesma)** in collaboration with the **Cadre Division**, aimed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of **gender equality** and **sexual violence prevention** in academic settings.

This initiative represents a strategic step in addressing the root causes of sexual violence, often stemming from deep-seated gender inequality in society. The program aligns with UPI’s vision of fostering a **safe, inclusive, and violence-free campus environment.**

“Voice for Change Vol. 2” was designed not only as an educational effort but also as a catalyst for **behavioral transformation** among students regarding gender equality issues. It combined **theoretical learning and practical prevention strategies** applicable in daily life.

The collaboration between **Adkesma** and **Cadre Development** created a sustainable **student empowerment model**, ensuring that participants are not only educated but also **prepared to become agents of change** on campus.

The event directly supports **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Gender Equality**, particularly **Target 5.2**, which calls for eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls. It also contributes to **SDG 4 (Quality Education)** by promoting a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students, and aligns with **SDG 16.1**, which seeks to reduce all forms of violence.

Several strategic recommendations emerged from this program:
1. Establishing **trained peer-support groups** to provide continuous assistance to students in need.  
2. Strengthening **collaboration with external organizations**, such as Komnas Perempuan and civil society groups, to expand the program’s outreach.  
3. Developing an **accessible and confidential reporting system** for sexual violence cases.  
4. Conducting **periodic evaluations** to measure program effectiveness and adjust strategies accordingly.  

The seminar featured **expert speakers** in gender equality and sexual violence prevention.  
**Dr. Ilsa Nelwan, MPH**, Founder and Advisor of the Indonesian Volunteer Network Foundation (JaRI), delivered insights from a **public health perspective** on addressing sexual violence.  
The second speaker, **Salsabila Syaira**, a **women’s rights activist**, discussed **gender studies and women’s movements** in preventing sexual violence.  

The event concluded with an interactive session led by UPI’s **Sexual Violence Prevention and Handling Task Force (SPPKS)**, emphasizing students’ understanding of common forms of sexual violence on campus. Participants engaged in discussions and completed **post-tests** to assess their comprehension.  

“Voice for Change Vol. 2” stands as a **tangible manifestation of UPI and FPBS’s commitment** to advancing social change through **inclusive and gender-responsive education**, setting an example for other universities in **preventing sexual violence** and **empowering students** to foster a safe academic community.
