Bandung, 12 November 2025  — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), actively participated in the event *“UPI Berjalan Serempak dan Berdampak”* held to commemorate UPI’s 71st Anniversary. The activity took place at the Bumi Siliwangi Campus and was attended by the entire UPI academic community, including university leaders, lecturers, education staff, and students.

The fun walk promoted a spirit of togetherness and social responsibility, in line with this year’s anniversary theme, *“Melesat Bersama untuk UPI Gemilang”* (*Soaring Together for an Excellent UPI*). Participants walked together across the campus area while engaging in positive actions such as maintaining environmental cleanliness, planting trees, and interacting with the surrounding community.

FPBS joined the event with enthusiasm and unity, represented by faculty leaders, lecturers, staff, and students from various study programs. Beyond symbolizing camaraderie, the event also strengthened solidarity within the UPI community and reaffirmed FPBS’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Dean of FPBS UPI, Prof. Dr. Wawan Gunawan, M.Hum., Ph.D., emphasized that FPBS’s participation reflects the faculty’s aspiration to promote a healthy, inclusive, and empowered campus environment.
