Bandung, November 15, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (FPBS UPI), proudly celebrates another outstanding achievement. Febri Herdiyanti, a student of the Sundanese Language Education Study Program, won 3rd Place in the Pasanggiri Nulis Naskah Monolog Basa Sunda 2025. The provincial-level competition, organized by the Sundanese Literature Student Association (Pamass) of Universitas Padjadjaran, was held from October 1–27, 2025 with the theme “Ngamumulé Basa, Manjangkeun Carita.”

Eighteen scripts underwent the initial curation process, from which ten were selected for final assessment by two Sundanese literary experts: Taufik Rahayu, M.Hum., and Dr. Asep Yusup Hudayat, S.S., M.A. Evaluation was based on character strength, storyline, thematic depth, and cultural relevance. For this competition, Febri submitted a script titled *“Lantéra Élmu,”* a monologue portraying the struggles of Raden Dewi Sartika, a pioneering Sundanese woman who advanced education for girls during the colonial era.

“Lantéra Élmu” received high praise for its humanistic portrayal, emotional depth, and strong narrative in illustrating Dewi Sartika’s resilience and dedication. During the awarding ceremony held on November 13, 2025 at the Japanese Studies Center Hall of UNPAD, evaluator Dr. Asep Yusup Hudayat, S.S., M.A., highlighted the script’s strengths. “The strength of character, storyline, and depth of writing made this work on Dewi Sartika fulfill several key assessment criteria,” he said.

Febri shared her gratitude and pride for the achievement, stating that the creative process behind *“Lantéra Élmu”* provided her with a deeper understanding of Dewi Sartika’s efforts in expanding education for women of her time. “I wanted to reintroduce Dewi Sartika to the younger generation through a form of performance that feels close to them. Writing this monologue opened my eyes to how significant her struggle was and how important it is to preserve that history,” she expressed.

She also encouraged young people, particularly Sundanese youth, to be brave in writing and elevating local cultural values. “If we are not bold enough to write works rooted in Sundanese values, then who will continue passing down these stories to the next generation?” she added.

Head of the Sundanese Language Education Study Program, Dr. Haris Santosa Nugraha, S.Pd., M.Pd., expressed his appreciation, emphasizing that student achievements reflect the Study Program’s commitment to strengthening cultural literacy, creativity, and students’ academic character. He affirmed that works like this support SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 11 (Local Cultural Preservation) through the development of literature rooted in Sundanese cultural heritage.

Febri Herdiyanti’s achievement stands as proof that FPBS UPI students possess great potential in preserving Sundanese language and culture through creative, inspiring, and contextually relevant literary works. This accomplishment is expected to inspire more young people to continue creating, appreciating local culture, and contributing to the sustainability of Sundanese cultural identity.
