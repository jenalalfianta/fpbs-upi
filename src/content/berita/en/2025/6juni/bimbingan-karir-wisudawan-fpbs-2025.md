**Bandung, June 10, 2025** â€” The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) once again demonstrated its commitment to the future of its graduates by holding a **Career Guidance Session for 2025 Batch II Graduates**.

The event began with an opening by the **Master of Ceremony (MC)**, followed by welcoming remarks from the **Vice Dean for Student Affairs of FPBS**. In his address, he expressed high hopes that the graduates would become cooperative alumni who actively maintain communication with the faculty and contribute positively to society.

Next, a session was presented by the **BKPK Directorate team** from UPI, providing guidance on the **tracer study** process. Graduates were informed of the administrative requirements to be fulfilled immediately after graduation, which include:

- Completing the **Exit Form** on the first day of becoming an alumnus  
- Filling out the **Tracer Study form** one year after graduation  

The tracer study plays a vital role in mapping alumni distribution and evaluating how higher education aligns with employment outcomes.

The event concluded with an **inspirational sharing session** by **Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd.**, an FPBS alumnus who now serves as a lecturer at his alma mater. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a passion for learning, building professional networks, and finding meaning in every role taken after graduation.

Through this initiative, FPBS hopes its graduates are not only prepared to enter the workforce but also continue to stay connected with the faculty as part of the extended FPBS UPI family.
