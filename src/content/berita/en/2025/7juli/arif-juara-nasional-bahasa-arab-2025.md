**Bandung, May 28, 2025** — Another proud achievement was earned by Arif Rahman Hakim, a student from the Arabic Language Education Study Program at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). In a national-level competition titled *Daur al-Lughah al-‘Arabiyyah fi Himayati at-Turats al-Tsaqafiy wa at-Ta’ziizi al-Hiwayah al-Hadarah fi ‘ashri al-Mujtama’*, Arif successfully won 1st Place nationally.

The competition was organized by UIN Walisongo Semarang on May 28, 2025, and was attended by dozens of participants from both public and private universities offering Arabic language programs. The competition’s theme focused on the role of the Arabic language in preserving cultural heritage and Islamic civilizational identity in the modern era.

Arif delivered an impressive performance marked by powerful rhetoric and in-depth arguments. His presentation captivated the judges, who consisted of experts in Arabic linguistics and Middle Eastern culture.

Arif’s success was greatly supported by intensive guidance from Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd., and Dr. Mia Nurmala, M.Pd., both of whom are known for actively mentoring students in competitions and academic forums.

Arif’s participation in the event was not merely for the sake of accolades, but also a reflection of the academic mission of UPI’s Arabic Language Education Program—to develop graduates who are not only theoretically competent but also able to compete at national and international levels.
