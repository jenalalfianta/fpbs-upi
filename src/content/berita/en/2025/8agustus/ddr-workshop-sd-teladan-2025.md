**Sleman, August 14, 2025** – The atmosphere at SD Teladan, Yayasan Sinai Indonesia, Sleman, Yogyakarta, was different today. Since morning, teachers enthusiastically attended the *Didactical Design Research (DDR) Workshop* organized by the Community Service Team of the Arabic Language Education Study Program, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). The activity aligns with the spirit of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, emphasizing quality education through teacher training and inter-institutional collaboration.  

The DDR method, pioneered by **Prof. Dr. Didi Suryadi, M.Ed.**, was designed to help teachers ensure that the material delivered in class is truly valid knowledge—not merely opinions or unverified information. In his presentation, Prof. Didi encouraged teachers to critically distinguish between information that is categorized as hoax, *doxa* (not yet certain), and genuine knowledge. Beyond theory, he also shared key strategies for fostering quality learning: understanding three types of knowledge (*know-that, know-how,* and *know-why*), and addressing learning obstacles from both didactical and psychological perspectives.  

The second speaker, **Dr. Asep Sofyan, M.Ag.**, added that this DDR method has already been introduced to students of the Arabic Language Education Study Program at UPI. As a result, many students have successfully written DDR-based scientific articles and published them in reputable journals. “This proves that DDR is not just a theoretical concept but can truly be applied to produce academically recognized work,” he explained.  

The workshop was attended enthusiastically by SD Teladan teachers, alongside the UPI community service team: **Prof. Dr. Maman Abdurrahman, M.Ag., Yusuf Ali Tantowi, Lc., M.A., M. Farhan, M.Pd., and Dr. Rinaldi, M.Pd.** Their presence added academic weight to the event and strengthened ties between UPI and SD Teladan. The Principal of SD Teladan, **Mrs. Nur Hilawah, S.Pd.**, who officially opened the workshop, expressed her gratitude to the UPI team: *“We hope this DDR knowledge can be directly applied in the classroom to enhance the quality of our students’ learning,”* she said with enthusiasm.  

This workshop also represented a concrete step in supporting **SDG 4: Quality Education** by providing teachers with opportunities to improve their competencies and deliver more inclusive, equitable, and globally competitive education. Additionally, the collaboration between UPI and SD Teladan reflects the implementation of **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals**, where synergy between universities and elementary schools strengthens the quality of education in Indonesia.  

The workshop concluded with a group photo and informal conversations between participants and speakers. For the teachers of SD Teladan, it was a valuable moment: gaining new insights, sharing experiences, and becoming more motivated to teach using methods that are structured and well-tested.
