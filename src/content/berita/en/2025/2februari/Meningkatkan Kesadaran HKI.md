The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) held an intellectual property (IP) awareness event initiated by the UPI Directorate of Innovation, Publication, and Intellectual Property (DIPUU UPI). The event aimed to enhance the academic community's understanding of the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR) and to encourage an increase in the number of registered IPRs within FPBS.

The event took place on 13 February 2025 at the FPBS UPI Auditorium. It began with an opening session and the singing of the Indonesian national anthem. The event was officially opened by the Dean of FPBS following welcoming remarks delivered virtually by the Director of DIPUU UPI.

The keynote speaker, **Mr. Ari Arifin Danuwijaya, M.Ed., Ph.D.**, delivered a comprehensive presentation on the urgency of intellectual property protection, the procedures for IPR registration, and strategies to boost IPR submissions in academic settings. His presentation provided valuable insights for both lecturers and students on the role of IPR in supporting innovation and achieving academic recognition.

Following the presentation, participants had the opportunity to engage directly with the speaker during a Q&A session. The discussion was highly interactive, with many questions raised concerning the technical aspects of registration and funding for IPR submissions.

The event concluded with a message of encouragement for all members of the FPBS academic community to become more actively involved in registering IPRs for their academic and innovative works. **(Teja Mustika)**
