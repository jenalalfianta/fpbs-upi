**Purwakarta, July 20–26, 2025** – The Arabic Language Student Association (KEMABA) of FPBS UPI once again held its annual *Community Service and Engagement Week* (PLP2M) 2025 under the theme *“Serving with Sincerity, Making an Impact, Leaving Traces of Goodness.”* The program took place in Pasanggrahan Village, Bojong Subdistrict, Purwakarta Regency.  

PLP2M is an incidental program organized by the Student Executive Board (BEM) of KEMABA FPBS UPI under the coordination of Qismul Muwashalah Al-Ijtima’iyyah (Public Relations Division). The implementation of PLP2M included a variety of activities, such as teaching at SDN Pasanggrahan and DTA Al-Barokah, a low-cost clothing bazaar, home visits, orphan support, public outreach and distribution of basic necessities, teacher upgrading, and student participation in community activities such as religious gatherings and communal work (*gotong royong*).  

The opening ceremony was held in the Pasanggrahan Village Hall and inaugurated by village officials, namely the heads of hamlet 2 and hamlet 3, accompanied by **Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd.**, student advisor representing KEMABA. The opening event was also attended by village officials and PLP2M student participants.  

### Clothing Bazaar and Home Visits  

One of the social activities that drew community attention was the **Secondhand Clothing Bazaar** initiated by the Social Service Division. Held in the courtyard of the Pasanggrahan Village Office, the bazaar was open daily from 09:00 to 15:00 WIB on July 21–26, 2025. Offering affordable prices, residents could purchase a variety of clothing for all groups. Beyond economic benefits, this activity also strengthened community ties and nurtured a spirit of sharing.  

In addition to the bazaar, **home visits** led by the Public Relations Division became another key part of PLP2M. Conducted on July 20–24, 2025, the home visit team visited local community leaders, SMEs, and village economic centers, including coffee milling, broom weaving, banana chip production, and blacksmith workshops. The visits aimed to introduce PLP2M programs while providing opportunities to exchange experiences and explore local village potential.  

### Orphan Support and Public Outreach  

The Social Service Division also organized an **Orphan Support Program** held at the Pasanggrahan RW Hall. The event began with a warm greeting from the MC, followed by remarks from the PLP2M 2025 committee chair, who expressed hopes that the activity would serve as a charitable contribution, strengthen community bonds, and bring happiness to the orphans. With data provided by village officials, assistance was accurately distributed to 25 orphans in attendance.  

On Friday, July 25, 2025, a public outreach program on *“Social Ethics as the Foundation for a Meaningful Life”* was delivered by **Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd.** He emphasized the important role of parents and the elderly in guiding the younger generation and maintaining harmony. The program concluded with the distribution of 50 basic needs packages to elderly residents as a form of student social care.  

### Teacher Upgrading and Closing Ceremony  

The following day, Saturday, July 26, 2025, the **Teacher Upgrading Program** was held for teachers at SDN 1 Pasanggrahan and MDTA Al-Barokah. With the theme *“Utilizing Artificial Intelligence in Learning”*, **Ahmad Juliar Fahri, S.Pd. (Kang Ijul)** presented material on the use of AI technology to support the learning process without diminishing the teacher’s role. He also reminded participants of the importance of synergy between teachers and parents in educating students in the digital era.  

The PLP2M 2025 program officially closed on Saturday evening, July 26, 2025, at the Pasanggrahan Village Hall. The closing event was lively with performances of *marawis*, art shows by MDTA students, speeches by community leaders, and appreciation from the committee. The event symbolized the harmony between students, the community, and village officials.  

### Long-Term Impact and SDGs  

PLP2M 2025 left a lasting impression of close bonds between students and residents, a growing spirit of cooperation, and inspiration to continue spreading kindness for shared progress. The program also aligns with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly in supporting quality education, poverty alleviation, health and well-being, and partnerships for the goals.  

Through activities such as teaching, orphan support, public outreach, and local economic empowerment, students actively contributed to building a more empowered and inclusive village, while also reinforcing the university’s commitment to sustainable development.
