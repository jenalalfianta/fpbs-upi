**Bandung, October 2, 2025** – **UPI Laboratory School (SMA Labschool Percontohan UPI)** has become one of the partner schools in the implementation of the **Professional Education Strengthening Program (P3K)** initiated by **Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI)**. This program is participated in by UPI students as a form of implementing the **Tri Dharma of Higher Education** and as a tangible contribution to achieving the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),** particularly in the area of **Quality Education.**  

As an initial step, the **handover ceremony for P3K student participants** at UPI Laboratory School took place on **September 15, 2025.** The event was marked by the signing of an **Implementation Agreement** and a **Cooperation Agreement (PKS)** between Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia and the partner school. The documents were signed separately by **Hj. Komalia, M.Pd.,** Principal of UPI Laboratory School, and **Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D.,** Dean of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) UPI. The ceremony was also attended by students from the **Arabic Language Education Study Program (FPBS UPI)** who are participants of the P3K program.  

Through this program, UPI students placed at the UPI Laboratory School have the opportunity to develop their **pedagogical, professional, social, and personal competencies** as future educators. The activities include not only teaching practice but also **developing learning materials, mentoring students,** and **applying technology-based learning innovations.**  

**Hj. Komalia, M.Pd.,** Principal of UPI Laboratory School, expressed her appreciation for the program’s implementation. She stated that collaboration between students and teachers fosters a more dynamic learning atmosphere and serves as a strategic step in preparing excellent and competent future educators.  

As part of its support, the school has assigned **supervising teachers (guru pamong)** to assist students. Their presence is expected to help students understand the school culture, classroom dynamics, and professional classroom management.  

With the implementation of the P3K Program at UPI Laboratory School, it is hoped that **synergy between higher education and schools** will continue to grow in achieving **SDG 4 (Quality Education):** ensuring inclusive, equitable, and high-quality education while promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.
