**Yogyakarta, August 15, 2025** — Lecturers from the French Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) conducted a Community Service Program (PkM) under the theme *“Training on Converting Research Reports (undergraduate theses, master’s theses, doctoral dissertations) into Popular Scientific Books (Monographs/Reference Works)”*. The training was held at the French Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Languages, Arts, and Culture (FBSB), Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (UNY), in WS Rendra Building, on Friday, August 15, 2025, featuring three lecturers from UPI’s French Language Education Study Program as speakers.  

This PkM activity was particularly important, as many lecturers and students at the partner institution face challenges in converting research reports—whether undergraduate theses, master’s theses, doctoral dissertations, or other research reports—into publishable popular scientific books (monographs/references). The training was attended by 13 lecturers who already had research reports ready for conversion and 14 students who had completed their undergraduate theses. Participants not only received materials but also practiced the process of converting research reports into publishable monographs/references, ensuring that research results would not remain in libraries but could reach a wider audience through printed or electronic books (e-books).  

The first speaker, **Prof. Dr. Dadang Sunendar, M.Hum.**, explained the Indonesian book system policy outlined in Law No. 3 of 2017, which regulates stakeholders in the publishing industry, types and contents of books, rights and obligations, roles of the central and local governments, manuscript acquisition, publishing, printing, e-book development, distribution, usage, provision, and supervision. The law also stipulates legal enforcement and administrative sanctions for violations of its provisions.  

The second session, delivered by **Ariessa Racmadhany, M.Pd.**, explored writing and publishing textbooks, monographs, and reference books. The presentation highlighted strategies and tips for writing scientific books, ranging from those intended for primary and secondary schools to higher education.  

The third speaker, **Yadi Mulyadi, M.Pd.**, emphasized the significance of publishing scientific books as research outputs. Publishing research findings in book form offers numerous benefits, including increased visibility, deeper topic exploration, enhanced credibility and career advancement, and broader societal impact. He also highlighted regulations from the National Library of Indonesia, specifically Regulation No. 5 of 2022 on ISBN Services, which arose in response to the surge of ISBN applications for books that were merely research reports (theses, dissertations, etc.) not yet converted into standard book formats accessible to the general public. According to him, conversion is crucial to ensure that published books are not only accessible to academics but also to the wider society, with appropriate presentation, structure, and content.  

Despite the success of the training, challenges remain. Academics—both lecturers and students—encounter significant difficulties in the conversion process. These include:  

1. **Adapting Writing Style:** Research reports are highly formal and technical, while books require a more narrative and accessible style.  
2. **Restructuring Content:** Reports are rigidly structured; books must flow logically with engaging context.  
3. **Simplifying Complex Content:** Some material is too specialized and needs simplification without losing accuracy.  
4. **Defining Target Audience:** Books aim at wider readers, requiring adjustments in tone and presentation.  
5. **Incorporating Visual Elements:** Books often need illustrations, charts, or tables to aid comprehension.  
6. **Time and Resources:** Conversion is time-intensive and demands significant effort.  
7. **Funding and Publishing:** Finding publishers or financing self-publication can be a challenge.  
8. **Maintaining Consistency and Validity:** Converted books must remain scientifically accurate and consistent.  

On this occasion, a **Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** was also signed between UPI’s French Language Education Study Program (FPBS) and UNY’s French Language Education Study Program (FBSB) as a tangible step in cross-institutional academic collaboration. The agreement is expected to strengthen academic networks, improve scientific publications, and contribute to the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly Goal 4 (Quality Education) and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  

The head of the community service team, **Dr. Rika Widawati, M.Pd.**, explained that this initiative would not stop at face-to-face training. Participants will also receive follow-up online training, ensuring continuous mentoring and skills development.  

Through this PkM, the French Language Education Study Program FPBS UPI hopes to assist partner academics in converting their research outputs into popular scientific books. The program is expected to enhance the quality of academic writing and contribute not only to the academic community but also to broader public literacy.
