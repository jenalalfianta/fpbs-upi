**Krapyak, August 14, 2025** — Pondok Pesantren Al-Munawwir Krapyak marked a new breakthrough by equipping its students with the ability to master Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. Through a Community Service Program organized by the **Indonesian Language and Literature Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education**, the extracurricular students of *Media Al-Munawwir* successfully introduced five AI-based digital platforms.  

### Strategic Academic–Pesantren Collaboration
The **“AI-Based Digital Content”** workshop was held in a hybrid format with speakers **Dr. Kholid Abdullah Harras, M.Pd.** and **Dr. Jatmika Nurhadi, S.S., M.Hum.**  
The event solemnly began with registration, Quran recitation, collective prayer, report by **Dr. Sri Wiyanti, S.S., M.Hum.** as the head of the Community Service Program, remarks from the representative of Pondok Pesantren Al-Munawwir, signing of an MoU partnership, presentation of souvenirs, and continued with learning sessions.  
> “Santri have great potential to develop creative digital content while still being in line with Islamic values,” said **Jatmika Nurhadi, S.S., M.Hum.** as one of the speakers.  

### Mastering Five Cutting-Edge AI Platforms
The santri learned five AI platforms: **Canva** for graphic design, **ChatGPT/DeepSeek** for creative writing, **VEO** for video, **Prosa AI** for narration, and **Suno** for music. The output of this program was student works in various forms through these media. During practice, participants were very enthusiastic in learning digital content creation.  

### Practice Output: AI Song Sample for Pesantren
The most notable achievement was the creation of an AI-based song sample that could serve as a musical identity reference for Pondok Pesantren Al-Munawwir. This work combined digital innovation with the spirituality of pesantren.  
> “This is the first time santri practiced making music using AI. The result is amazing and filled with Islamic values,” said the pesantren administrators.  

### Diverse Islamic Digital Works
In addition to the AI song, students produced creative writings with local wisdom, social media visual content for pesantren, multimedia da’wah products, and publication design templates.  

### Nurturing Digital, Character-Building Santri
This community service prepares a generation of santri who are tech-savvy without losing their spiritual identity. They are now ready to develop quality digital content to strengthen pesantren da’wah in the digital era.  
> “We hope the santri continue developing these skills and become pioneers in integrating AI technology with pesantren values,” concluded **Jatmika Nurhadi, S.S., M.Hum.**  

Pondok Pesantren Al-Munawwir Krapyak proves its commitment to innovate while preserving tradition. The santri are now a digital generation firmly grounded in religious and cultural values.
