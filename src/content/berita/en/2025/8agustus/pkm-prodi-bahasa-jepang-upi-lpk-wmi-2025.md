**Yogyakarta, August 14, 2025** â€” Eight lecturers from the Japanese Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), visited **Wakawashi Mandari Indonesia (WMI) Training Center** in Yogyakarta as part of the 2025 Community Service Program (PkM).  

The delegation was warmly welcomed by **Mr. Bambang**, who is responsible for the education division, and **Mr. Andri**, who manages administration. Meanwhile, the Director of WMI, **Mr. Suwartono**, was unable to attend the meeting as he was accompanying Japanese representatives.  

During the discussion, the UPI team and WMI shared insights on the challenges of teaching Japanese to prospective *gino jisshuu* (interns) preparing to work in Japan. WMI emphasized the importance of a selective recruitment process, along with training in ethics, mental resilience, and Japanese language proficiency. Since 2016, this approach has successfully prepared and sent numerous interns to Japan.  

For the Japanese Language Education Study Program at UPI, the challenge ahead is to prepare future LPK instructors who are not only skilled in language teaching but also capable of shaping the character and mental strength of their students.  

The lecturers also had the opportunity to observe classroom activities, meet with teachers, and interact directly with students during the visit.  

As a follow-up to this collaboration, the Study Program plans to invite **Mr. Bambang** as a guest lecturer in the *micro teaching* course. His presence is expected to provide practical insights and better prepare UPI students to enter the workforce in training institutions (LPK) focusing on preparing candidates for Japan.
