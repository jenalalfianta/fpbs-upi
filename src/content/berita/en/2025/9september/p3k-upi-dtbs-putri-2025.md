**Bandung, September 17, 2025** – Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) has responded to the dynamics of the times, technological advancement, and labor market demands through various innovative policies, one of which is the **Teacher Professional Experience Enhancement Program (P3K)** as part of the **Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM)** initiative.  

The program is an expansion of the **Educational Unit Field Introduction Program (PPLSP),** previously worth 4 credits, now extended to 20 credits. Its objective is to provide students with deeper and more contextual learning experiences through direct practice in educational institutions.  

P3K aligns with the spirit of MBKM, which encourages students to learn beyond their study programs and campuses, emphasizing flexible, innovative, and relevant learning that prepares them for the workforce and future challenges. Under lecturers’ guidance, students are directed to gain field experience that strengthens both **hard skills** and **soft skills**, producing adaptive, professional graduates ready to face social changes and industry demands.  

One concrete implementation of this program is the placement of students in various educational institutions, including **SMP Daarut Tauhiid Boarding School Putri**. The handover ceremony for UPI’s P3K students was held on **Wednesday, September 17, 2025**, at SMP Daarut Tauhiid Boarding School Putri. It was attended by Principal **Rika Sinta Komara, M.Pd.,** and her staff, Field Supervisor **Nalahuddin Saleh, S.Pd., M.Ag.,** as well as participating students from the Arabic Language Education and Guidance and Counseling Study Programs.  

The event began with an opening by **Mutia Hardianti, M.Pd.,** as MC, followed by a collective recitation of the Qur’an as a prayer and hope for the program’s success. The atmosphere grew warmer with welcoming remarks from the school and the Field Supervisor, who highlighted the importance of collaboration and the active role of students in supporting teaching and learning activities.  

The event continued with an introduction session between school members and students, where mentor teachers from each study program were introduced alongside the students who would undergo practice. An interactive Q&A session was also held, opening communication between the school and students regarding the program’s technical implementation.  

As a symbol of mutual commitment, the activity concluded with the signing of a cooperation document between the school and UPI, carried out directly by the Principal and the Field Supervisor.  

The program ended with a sense of warmth and hope that it would serve as a meaningful, constructive, and mutually beneficial learning platform for both parties. Through this program, students are expected not only to apply the knowledge they have acquired in class to real-life school settings but also to build readiness as professional educators who are competitive and possess noble character.
