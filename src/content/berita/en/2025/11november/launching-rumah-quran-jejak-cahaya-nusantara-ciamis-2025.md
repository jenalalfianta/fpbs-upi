Ciamis, November 23, 2025 — PD Salimah Ciamis, in collaboration with Perkumpulan Jejak Cahaya Nusantara (JCN) and the Indonesian Da’i Association (Ikadi) of Ciamis Regency, held the Launching of Rumah Qur’an Jejak Cahaya Nusantara alongside a Training Session on the Cahaya Method for Qur’an Memorization. The event was integrated with the Silaturahmi Forum of Majelis Taklim (Forsil MT) Salimah and took place at the Great Mosque of Ciamis.

The event was attended by leaders of various majelis taklim and community members, who received a lecture titled “Mulia dengan Al-Qur’an” delivered by Dr. Asep Sopian, M.Ag, a UPI lecturer and Secretary of JCN.

In his presentation, Dr. Asep emphasized that building a Qur’anic generation is an urgent necessity for the Muslim community. He highlighted two essential pillars: the Qur’an as a guide for life and the Qur’an as a source of spiritual strength. He noted that everything associated with the Qur’an becomes noble: “Prophet Muhammad became the leader of the prophets because he received revelation; Ramadan is honored due to the descent of the Qur’an; and the Muslim ummah becomes the best community because this holy scripture was revealed to them,” he explained.

Dr. Asep also elaborated on why Muslims must pursue nobility through the Qur’an, citing reasons such as its function as guidance, a source of honor, light and salvation, assurance of well-being in this world and the hereafter, and a standard of dignity for a community.

Following the Qur’anic motivation session, participants were introduced to the Cahaya Method, a Qur’an memorization approach developed by Rumah Qur’an Jejak Cahaya Nusantara. Musyrif and musyrifah then guided participants through a hands-on practice session.

This activity is expected to strengthen the community’s enthusiasm in continuously engaging with the Qur’an—through reading, reflection, and memorization.
