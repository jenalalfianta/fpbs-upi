**Bandung, September 1, 2025** â€“ The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), welcomed the beginning of the 2025/2026 odd semester on Monday (1/9). In accordance with circulars issued by the Rector and Vice Rectors of UPI, the first week of lectures was conducted online.  

This policy was outlined in three official circulars emphasizing the importance of ensuring smooth teaching and learning processes while providing an adjustment period for both lecturers and students after the semester break. Starting the following week, lectures will return to in-person learning at the FPBS campus.  

To ensure the quality of the teaching process, initial monitoring of lectures was carried out by the Chairs and Members of the **Quality Assurance Task Force (GKM)** of each study program, accompanied by educational and student affairs staff.  

FPBS UPI extends a warm welcome back to all students, lecturers, and academic staff. May this semester run smoothly, productively, and in the spirit of togetherness.
