**Bandung, July 2025** —  
The Dean of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd., has received a prestigious award from the *Fédération Internationale des Professeurs de Français* (FIPF), or the International Federation of Teachers of French. This recognition was given to her in her capacity as Chair of the *Association des Professeurs de Français d’Indonésie* (APFI), a professional organization considered the most active and dynamic in the Asia-Pacific region.

The FIPF praised Tri Indri Hardini’s leadership, which has driven continuous innovation in the development of French language education in Indonesia. APFI has consistently organized various initiatives, including national seminars, teacher training programs, curriculum strengthening efforts, and collaborations with educational institutions both nationally and internationally. These efforts represent APFI’s concrete contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Quality Education and building Global Partnerships for sustainable development.

The award was announced during the FIPF international forum, held in a hybrid format in July 2025. This forum is a prestigious gathering for French language educators from around the world to exchange ideas and strengthen professional networks. According to FIPF's assessment, APFI stood out for its program continuity, innovative teaching methods, and tangible impact on the French language teaching community in Indonesia.

Beyond enhancing foreign language education, Tri Indri Hardini and APFI’s work also aligns with other SDG principles, such as Gender Equality—achieved through the active involvement of women in the association’s leadership and activities—and reducing disparities by providing access to French teacher development programs in various regions, including remote areas.

In her statement, Tri Indri Hardini expressed her gratitude and hope that the award will inspire French language educators across Indonesia.  
“Hopefully, this is not only a form of recognition, but also a starting point to strengthen the position of foreign languages, especially French, in the national education system. We aim to continue contributing actively to the development of inclusive, collaborative, and sustainable education,” she said.

Looking ahead, APFI is committed to expanding its training programs, strengthening international collaboration, and promoting language education as a gateway to supporting sustainable global development goals.
