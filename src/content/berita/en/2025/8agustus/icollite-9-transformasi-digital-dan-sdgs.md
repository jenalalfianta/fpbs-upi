Bandung, August 6, 2025. The annual international conference ICOLLITE (International Conference on Language, Literature, Culture, and Education) was once again held by the Faculty of Language and Literature Education, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) on Wednesday, August 6, 2025. Carrying the theme “Digital Transformation in Language, Literature, Culture, and Education”, the 9th ICOLLITE affirmed the role of academia in supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in the areas of quality education, equal access to technology, preservation of local culture, and global collaboration.  
The conference was attended by hundreds of academics from various countries, both offline and online. They discussed, presented research, and formulated strategies to address 21st-century challenges through interdisciplinary approaches. In various sessions, participants highlighted how digital transformation plays a crucial role in achieving inclusive and high-quality education (SDG 4). Innovations in digital learning media, language learning technology (CALL/MALL), and online assessment were presented as solutions to improve teaching quality, particularly in areas with limited access.

“Many studies presented at ICOLLITE emphasized the importance of digital literacy, learning autonomy, and curriculum development that is responsive to 21st-century needs,” said one participant from Singapore.  
In addition to education, ICOLLITE also served as an important platform to discuss the preservation of local languages and cultural values in the context of urbanization and globalization. Studies on folklore, children's literature, etymology, and local media were tangible contributions to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 16 (inclusive and peaceful societies) by strengthening local identity and social harmony.  
“Preserving cultural heritage through literature and language is not merely academic romanticism, but part of the effort to create a just and sustainable society,” said a presenter from Thailand.  
ICOLLITE also strengthened global partnerships among educational and research institutions (SDG 17). Through this forum, several universities agreed on plans for joint research collaborations and international publications.

Ahmad Fuadin, Public Relations Officer of ICOLLITE 9, stated that this conference proved that the academic world can and must be actively involved in advancing the global agenda.  
“We believe that research and collaboration across disciplines and countries are concrete contributions of higher education to sustainable development,” said Ahmad Fuadin.  
Unlike many other academic conferences, ICOLLITE emphasized the importance of post-conference follow-up through scientific publications, dissemination of research results, and training programs. The main message was clear: digital transformation is not only about technology, but also about values, equity, and sustainability. By integrating the values of the SDGs into its scientific agenda, ICOLLITE positions UPI and Indonesia as active players in the global effort to create a smarter, fairer, and more sustainable future.
