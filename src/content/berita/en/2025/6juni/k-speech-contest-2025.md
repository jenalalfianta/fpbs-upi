**Bandung, June 28, 2025** — Another proud moment was achieved by a student of the Korean Language Education Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). **Allisya Nur Azharia** (2403967) won **1st Place** in the *23rd Indonesian K-Speech Contest*, a national-level competition held at **Lotte Shopping Avenue (Lotte Mall), Kuningan, Jakarta**, on Saturday, June 28, 2025.

Allisya delivered an impressive oration in Korean, captivating the judges and earning **a cash prize, medal, and certificate of achievement**. More significantly, she was honored with the opportunity to **represent Indonesia in the international round** of the contest, which will be held in **Vietnam**. This milestone not only brings pride to her alma mater but also serves as a remarkable achievement for Indonesia on the global stage.

In addition to Allisya’s success, two other students from the same program also achieved excellent results. **Narisa Aulia Jasmine** (2305896) and **Sapitri** (2303441) secured **3rd Place** in the same competition.
