**Bandung, July 11, 2025** — The Japanese Language Education Study Program (PBJ), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), welcomed a visit from the Japanese Language Program for Indonesian Nurse & Care Worker – IJEPA Division of The Japan Foundation Jakarta. The visiting team consisted of Asai Amai (Program Coordinator), Owaki Gen (Japanese Language Expert), and Elsa Mutiara Annisa Nonik, a 2016 PBJ alumna who now works as a Japanese language teacher for the EPA program at The Japan Foundation Jakarta.

The discussion took place in an informal yet meaningful atmosphere at the PBJ FPBS UPI campus, involving program leadership and faculty members. The main focus was on strengthening curriculum and instructional strategies for Japanese language learning, particularly tailored to Indonesian nurses and care workers preparing under the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Indonesia and Japan.

In addition to addressing the challenges and needs of Japanese language instruction for healthcare professionals, the meeting also served as an important moment to explore potential collaboration opportunities between higher education institutions and international organizations—especially in enhancing graduates’ competencies to compete globally.

The Head of the Japanese Language Education Program, Prof. Nuria Haristiani, M.Ed., Ph.D., expressed her appreciation for the visit:

> “We warmly welcome this discussion as an initial step toward strengthening synergy between higher education and international institutions. We aim to ensure that our graduates possess applicable and contextual language competencies, including in the healthcare sector.”

Meanwhile, the Dean of FPBS UPI, Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd., emphasized the importance of international collaboration in supporting quality language education:

> “Language is a bridge between nations. Through collaborations like this, we hope not only to improve the quality of teaching, but also to expand international mobility opportunities for our students and alumni.”

Although this event was internal in nature, it highlighted FPBS UPI’s strong commitment to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The presence of Elsa, an alumna who now contributes to international education through the Japan Foundation, also served as an inspiring testament to PBJ UPI graduates’ role in the global education ecosystem.

Through this meeting, it is hoped that long-term cooperation will be established between PBJ FPBS UPI and The Japan Foundation Jakarta in developing contextual, integrated Japanese language education that prepares Indonesian professionals to compete on the global stage.
