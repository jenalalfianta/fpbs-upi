**Bandung, July 14, 2025** — Proud news comes once again from the Korean Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). One of its students, Adinda Safitri Ayuningsih (2104526), has been selected as a participant in the SMU-KF Fellowship Program (*Sookmyung International Summer School*) 2025, which will be held from July 18 to August 14, 2025, in South Korea.

This program is a collaboration between Sookmyung Women’s University (SMU) and The Korea Foundation (KF), aiming to broaden international students’ perspectives on Korean language, culture, and society through lectures, cultural exchanges, and academic and institutional visits in South Korea.

Adinda’s selection for this prestigious program came through a highly competitive international selection process. She will join students from various countries to attend summer classes, deepen her understanding of Korea, and strengthen global student networks.

UPI’s participation in the SMU-KF Fellowship Program aligns with several points of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4: Quality Education. This program opens access to cross-cultural education and provides meaningful international learning experiences. Students not only study language and culture theoretically but also experience them directly through cultural immersion. SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals is also represented through this initiative.

This activity demonstrates the importance of international cooperation between educational institutions in Indonesia and South Korea in supporting student mobility, fostering intercultural understanding, and building a global higher education network.

This achievement is a testament to the Korean Language Education Study Program at UPI in preparing students who are academically excellent, globally competitive, and capable of serving as cultural and educational bridges between nations.

UPI extends its congratulations and best wishes to Adinda Safitri Ayuningsih for this outstanding achievement and hopes that her experience will inspire other students to pursue international opportunities and continue striving for excellence.
