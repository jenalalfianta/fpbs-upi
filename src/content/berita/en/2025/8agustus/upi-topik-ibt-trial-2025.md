A total of 100 participants took part in the trial, consisting of 50 participants for TOPIK I and 50 participants for TOPIK II. The Head of the Korean Language Education Study Program at UPI, Mr. Didin Samsudin, S.E., M.M., served as the Head of the Committee. As tangible support, the Korean government through KECI donated 120 Hangeul keyboards and 120 desk partitions. This contribution not only strengthened the exam infrastructure but also demonstrated the Korean government’s commitment to improving the quality of Korean language education in Indonesia.

### Relevance to the SDGs  
The TOPIK IBT trial is closely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promoted globally:  

1. **SDG 4: Quality Education** – TOPIK IBT provides broader, more equitable, and technology-based access for students to measure their Korean language proficiency at an international level.  
2. **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure** – Implementing internet-based exams encourages the digitalization of education and the use of environmentally friendly technology, which is more efficient than traditional paper-based exams.  
3. **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals** – The close collaboration between UPI, the Korean government, KECI, and NIIED serves as a concrete example of international cooperation in advancing language education.  

Through this initiative, UPI reaffirms its commitment as a pioneering university that supports quality education, global competitiveness, and alignment with sustainable development agendas.
