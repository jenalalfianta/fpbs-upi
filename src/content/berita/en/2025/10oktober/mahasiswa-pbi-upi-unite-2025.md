**Yogyakarta, October 19, 2025** — A student from the **English Education Study Program**, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), has once again brought pride to the university on the national stage.  
In the **UNITE 2025 English Debate Competition** organized by **Yogyakarta State University (UNY)** on October 18–19, 2025, the UPI debate team — consisting of **Fatia Filaisil Aghniya** (English Education) and **Tri Nathania Saidah** (Psychology) — achieved the **2nd Runner Up (3rd Place)** title.  
Additionally, **Fatia Filaisil Aghniya** received the **3rd Best Speaker** award for her consistent performance, critical thinking, and eloquence throughout the competition.  

The **UNITE (UNY English Debate Competition)** is an annual national debate event that brings together students from universities across Indonesia. The competition challenges participants to think critically, construct logical arguments, and express their perspectives on relevant social and global issues.  

In her interview, Fatia expressed her gratitude for the achievement.  
> “This was my first time competing in the National Open category, and I didn’t expect to reach this far. Even though we only practiced three times as a new team, this experience was incredibly valuable to me. It reminded me how much I love debating and how much potential I still have to grow,” said **Fatia Filaisil Aghniya.**

This accomplishment aligns with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly **SDG 4: Quality Education**, which emphasizes the importance of developing students’ competencies, communication skills, and critical thinking abilities.  
Moreover, the active participation of various universities reflects the spirit of **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals**, promoting collaboration and knowledge exchange among students from diverse academic institutions.  

FPBS UPI extends its **highest appreciation** to **Fatia Filaisil Aghniya** and **Tri Nathania Saidah** for their hard work and outstanding achievement. Their success serves as an inspiration for other students to continue honing their **critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills** in pursuit of high-quality and sustainable education.
