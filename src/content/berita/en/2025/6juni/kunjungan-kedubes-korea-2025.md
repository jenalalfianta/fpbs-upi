**Bandung, June 16, 2025** — The Korean Language Education Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) welcomed an honorary visit from the **Deputy Chief of Mission of the Embassy of the Republic of Korea**, **Mr. Park Soo-deok**, on Monday, June 16, 2025.

This visit was part of Mr. Park’s attendance at the **inauguration of UPI Rector for the 2025–2030 term**, **Prof. Dr. H. Didi Sukyadi, M.A.**, as well as an effort to strengthen bilateral cooperation between the Embassy of the Republic of Korea and UPI, particularly within the Korean Language Education Program.

Mr. Park’s arrival was warmly welcomed by lecturers and students in an atmosphere full of friendliness and a spirit of collaboration. The meeting served as a meaningful moment to build trust and enhance synergy between Indonesian and South Korean educational institutions, particularly in the fields of language education and cultural exchange.

Through this visit, it is hoped that more opportunities for collaboration will emerge between UPI and educational institutions in South Korea, including student exchange programs, scholarships, and faculty training. This step not only enhances the quality of Korean language education but also equips students to face global challenges through international exposure.

Furthermore, this initiative supports the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, especially **SDG 4: Quality Education**, which emphasizes strengthening academic capacity through global partnerships, and **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals**, which highlights the importance of international cooperation in education and culture.

This activity reflects a **shared commitment** to advancing Korean language education in Indonesia and to strengthening the bridge of cultural diplomacy between the two friendly nations, **Indonesia and South Korea**.
