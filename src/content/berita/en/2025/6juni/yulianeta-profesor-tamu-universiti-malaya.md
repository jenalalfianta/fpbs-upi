**Kuala Lumpur, June 3, 2025** — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), continues to expand its international academic collaborations through the participation of **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd.**, Vice Dean for Academic Affairs at FPBS, as a **Guest Professor** at **Universiti Malaya (UM)**.

The public lecture, titled *“Representation of Women in Indonesian & Malaysian Folktales”*, was held at **Bilik Kuliah Kemboja, Academy of Malay Studies, Universiti Malaya**, on Tuesday, June 3, 2025, at 10:00 AM local time.

In her session, Prof. Yulianeta invited the audience to reflect on how female characters in Southeast Asian folktales—such as *Keong Mas* and *Dayang Senandung*—serve as mirrors of cultural values and illustrate the tension between traditional patriarchal norms and modern ideals of female emancipation. The lecture emphasized folktales as a medium for understanding the evolving roles of women in society.

This guest lecture was part of a broader **collaborative research initiative between FPBS UPI and Universiti Malaya**, in cooperation with UM academics **Dr. Halimah** and **Dr. Mardian Shah Omar**. The collaboration aims to explore **interdisciplinary studies on gender representation and cultural narratives in Southeast Asia**.

Future prospects discussed during the visit included joint research projects, co-publications, student and faculty exchange programs, and international seminars. This academic endeavor is expected to **strengthen FPBS’s global engagement** and foster **meaningful cultural dialogues through a wider academic network**.

FPBS UPI warmly welcomes this opportunity as a **recognition of its scholarly excellence** and a **foundation for long-term international cooperation** in cultural and educational studies.
