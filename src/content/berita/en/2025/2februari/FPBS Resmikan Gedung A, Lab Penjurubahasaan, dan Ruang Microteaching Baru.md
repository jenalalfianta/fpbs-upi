Bandung, January 2025 – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) has officially resumed the use of **Building A**, which was previously occupied by the Faculty of Art and Design Education (FPSD). With FPSD now relocated to its new premises, Building A has been returned to FPBS as part of ongoing efforts to improve academic infrastructure.

Additionally, FPBS received a government grant to develop a brand-new **Interpreting Lab** and **Microteaching Room** on the 4th floor. This development represents a strategic step toward enhancing the quality of education, particularly in language instruction and teacher training.

To mark the return to Building A and the inauguration of these two new labs, FPBS held a thanksgiving ceremony and communal prayer. The event was attended by faculty leadership, lecturers, administrative staff, and students who will directly benefit from the upgraded facilities.

In his remarks, the Dean of FPBS expressed hope that the new facilities would further optimize the learning experience and contribute to producing more competent graduates who are ready to compete in the job market.

This inauguration represents a significant milestone for FPBS in strengthening its academic infrastructure in support of the faculty’s vision to become a center of excellence in language and literature education. **(Teja Mustika)**
