**Bandung, July 14, 2025** — Another proud achievement has been made by a student from the Korean Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). Ni Putu Ayu Raditya Widnyani (2407799), a 2024 cohort student, has successfully won first place in the beginner level (초급) category of the prestigious 2025 K-Dream Speech Contest at the international level.

The competition was organized by K-Dream Vision, South Korea, and conducted online. The winners were announced on July 12, 2025, following a rigorous judging process involving participants from various countries currently learning the Korean language.

This event serves as a platform for Korean language learners around the world to demonstrate language proficiency, share ideas, and present perspectives on global issues and Korean culture with confidence and creativity. In her performance, Ni Putu Ayu not only demonstrated fluency in Korean but also conveyed her ideas clearly, inspiringly, and enthusiastically.

This achievement is closely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4: Quality Education. The success of this UPI student reflects access to quality language education and highlights the role of higher education institutions in promoting global competence, intercultural literacy, and cross-linguistic communication skills. It also relates to SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.

The student’s participation in this international event underscores the importance of global collaboration and partnerships—especially between educational institutions in Indonesia and South Korea—in fostering intercultural understanding and strengthening diplomacy through language education.

This victory is not only a personal accomplishment but also a reflection of the high quality of education provided by UPI’s Korean Language Education Program in nurturing students to become competent cultural and linguistic ambassadors on the international stage.

Through this achievement, UPI once again affirms its commitment to producing graduates who are not only academically excellent but also globally competitive and contributors to sustainable development through education and culture.
