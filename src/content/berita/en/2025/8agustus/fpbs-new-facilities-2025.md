**Bandung, August 20, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Arts Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), inaugurated its new Meeting Room on the 1st floor of Building A and the FPBS Canteen on Wednesday (20/8) from 09.00 to 12.00 WIB, held at the Building A 1st Floor Lobby. The event was attended by Vice Deans, Heads and Secretaries of Study Programs, Heads and Secretaries of Expertise Groups (SKM), Heads and Secretaries of Laboratories, as well as FPBS administrative staff who witnessed this important milestone together.  

The event began with an opening by the MC and the singing of the Indonesian national anthem, followed by remarks from the Acting Dean of FPBS, **Prof. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd.** In her speech, she emphasized that the new meeting room is expected to become a center for the birth of great ideas, strengthen coordination, and lead FPBS toward greater advancement and excellence at the national and international levels. Afterwards, a prayer was led by **Prof. Sofyan Sauri**, followed by the call to prayer (adzan) delivered by **Mr. Jujun, Asep, and Nuryaman** as a symbol of gratitude.  

The inauguration was marked by the ceremonial cutting of tumpeng rice and ribbon-cutting by the faculty leadership, followed by direct visits to the new meeting room and canteen. Guests were then invited to tour the facilities as a reflection of the faculty’s commitment to supporting academic activities and the well-being of its community. The event concluded with a warm gathering that strengthened bonds among leaders, lecturers, and staff.  

The inauguration of the meeting room and canteen is not merely an addition of facilities but also a reflection of UPI’s commitment to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The new meeting room supports **Quality Education (SDG 4)** through more effective academic and research management, while the healthy canteen contributes to **Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3)**. These facilities also embody **Sustainable and Inclusive Campus Development (SDG 11)** and strengthen **Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17)**.  

With the inauguration of these two strategic facilities, FPBS UPI further strengthens its steps toward creating an educational environment that is not only productive and comfortable but also oriented toward sustainability and shared well-being.
