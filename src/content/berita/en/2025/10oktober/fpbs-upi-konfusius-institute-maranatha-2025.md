**FPBS UPI Strengthens Academic Networks through a Visit to the Confucius Institute at Maranatha Christian University**

**Bandung, October 9, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), conducted an **academic visit** to the **Confucius Institute at Maranatha Christian University** as part of the **preparation for establishing a Mandarin Language Study Program.**  
The meeting not only strengthened academic ties but also marked the initial step in planning a **Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** to support the creation of the **Mandarin Language and Culture Study Program** at FPBS UPI.  

The FPBS UPI delegation was led by **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd.** (Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Quality Assurance), accompanied by **Amirush Shaffa Fauzia, S.Pd., M.Pd.** They were warmly welcomed at the Confucius Institute building by **Mr. Kang** (Confucius Institute representative), **Dr. Livia Vasantadjaja, S.S., B.A., M.Lit.** (Lecturer of Chinese Literature), and **Agung Tyastuti Dinar Kartika Sari Hartono Yunior, S.H.** (Head of Institutional and Corporate Relations at Maranatha Christian University).  

The discussion explored various opportunities for collaboration, including the use of **language laboratories** and **learning platforms** at the Confucius Institute, as well as potential **research and community service partnerships.**  
Dr. Livia highlighted that Maranatha’s strength lies in the diversity of its Mandarin language studies—covering literature, linguistics, and pedagogy.  
> “We continue to develop academic learning relevant to the times. Collaboration with UPI has the potential to create a more innovative learning ecosystem,” she stated.  

An interesting point raised during the discussion was **international competency standards.** In Malaysia, for instance, students are required to achieve **HSK 5** before entering the program, while in Indonesia, it is generally the graduation target. This insight serves as an important note for FPBS UPI to design a more globally competitive curriculum.  
The discussion also recommended **Universiti Malaya (UM)** as a benchmark partner, given its strong reputation in Mandarin language education and its successful integration of language competence with industry needs.  

This visit underscores the urgency of formalizing an **MoU between UPI and Maranatha Christian University** as a foundation for sustainable academic collaboration. Through this initiative, FPBS UPI reaffirms its commitment not only to launching a new study program but also to **building a Mandarin language education foundation that is high-quality, internationally aligned, and globally relevant.**  

Through this cross-campus collaboration, UPI aims to nurture **adaptive, competent graduates ready to compete on the global stage.**
