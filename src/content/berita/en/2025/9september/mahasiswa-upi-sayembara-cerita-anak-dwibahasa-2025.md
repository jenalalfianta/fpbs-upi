**Bandung, September 17, 2025** – Another proud achievement was earned by a student of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). **Andrian**, a student of the Indonesian Language and Literature Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education, UPI (Class of 2022, Linguistics concentration), was selected as one of the 100 authors in the **2025 Bilingual (Sundanese–Indonesian) Children’s Storybook Writing Competition**, organized by the West Java Provincial Language Office.  

The competition aims to produce high-quality children’s literature, support school literacy, and strengthen learning based on **STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics)**. Andrian’s work, titled *“Science Around Us,”* tells the story of a child who learns science through a space-themed crossword puzzle. The story conveys the important message that simple and unexpected things can play a vital role in the journey of achieving dreams.  

As part of the competition series, the selected authors were invited to attend the **2025 Bilingual (Sundanese–Indonesian) Children’s Storybook Writing Workshop**. The workshop was held on Wednesday, September 17, 2025, from 07:30 AM to 05:30 PM at Aula Rempug Jukung, 4th Floor, BBGTK West Java, Jalan Diponegoro No. 12, Bandung. The event was opened by the Head of the West Java Provincial Language Office, **Dr. Herawati, S.S., M.A.,** together with the Head of the Translation Working Team.  

The workshop agenda included prize distribution, evaluation of bilingual children’s story writing by two speakers, and intensive discussions between the resource team and participants. Participants were required to bring laptops, while the committee provided meals and seminar kits. The official invitation also emphasized the commitment of the West Java Provincial Language Office not to accept any form of gratuity during the event.  

Andrian’s participation in this prestigious event is not only a personal achievement but also contributes positively to UPI’s reputation, particularly in the development of bilingual children’s literature. This accomplishment is expected to inspire other students to continue creating, innovating, and contributing to advancing literacy in Indonesia.  

High-quality children’s literature that supports school literacy directly contributes to improving education quality (**SDG 4**) and early literacy learning. In addition, competitions like this involve various stakeholders, including the Language Office and literary communities, fostering collaboration and partnerships (**SDG 17**) in developing children’s literature and educational content.  

This achievement is not only academically and literarily significant but also reinforces values of literacy, innovation, and educational inclusion, in line with the SDGs’ goals of creating equitable, quality education that supports sustainable development.
