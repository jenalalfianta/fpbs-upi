**Bandung, July 11, 2025** — The German Language Education Study Program at the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), welcomed a site visit from the Independent Accreditation Agency for Teacher Education (LAMDIK) on Thursday–Friday, July 10–11, 2025. This visit was part of the accreditation process to assess the quality of higher education and represents UPI's commitment to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 4: Quality Education.

The assessment team consisted of:
- Dr. Dewi Kartika Ardiyani, M.Pd. from Universitas Negeri Malang  
- Dr. Dwiyanto Djoko Pranowo, M.Pd. from Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta

The visit began with a formal welcome at the Partere Isola Building, followed by a campus tour using electric vehicles developed by students of the Faculty of Technology and Vocational Education (FPTK) UPI—demonstrating practical support for eco-friendly innovation (SDG 9).

Upon arrival at FPBS, the assessors participated in a declaration signing ceremony in the FPBS Auditorium, followed by a coffee break and a presentation by the Study Program Management Unit (UPPS) in the 1st-floor meeting room.

Throughout the two-day assessment, the assessors held sessions with various stakeholders: lecturers, academic staff, students, alumni, and graduate users. These sessions served as an opportunity for collective reflection to further improve academic quality and curriculum relevance to workforce needs.

On the second day, the assessors conducted on-site evaluations of faculty facilities and observed a microteaching session by a lecturer from the German Language Education Study Program as part of the teaching quality assessment.

This activity not only aimed to meet national accreditation standards but also strengthened inter-institutional partnerships (SDG 17) and promoted sustainable development within higher education institutions.

Dean of FPBS UPI, Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd., expressed her appreciation for the cooperation and readiness of the entire academic community in welcoming the assessment process. She emphasized that this moment is crucial for comprehensive evaluation and for advancing the continuous improvement of academic services.

> “We hope that the results of this assessment reflect FPBS’s commitment to delivering higher education that is excellent, inclusive, and globally relevant. This aligns with the spirit of the SDGs, especially in supporting quality education and sustainable development,” stated Dr. Yulianeta.

Meanwhile, Head of the German Language Education Study Program, Irma Permatawati, M.Pd., hoped that this process would enhance the program’s presence and competitiveness at both the national and international levels.

> “We have done our utmost to prepare all required documents and supporting facilities according to LAMDIK standards. We truly hope this assessment will serve as a launching point for future program development, including expanding international collaborations and enriching student learning experiences,” she said.
