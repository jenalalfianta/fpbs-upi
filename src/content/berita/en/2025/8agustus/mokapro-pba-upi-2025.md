**Bandung, August 26, 2025** – The Arabic Language Education Study Program (PBA), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, held **MOKAPRO** (Study Program Orientation Week) at the Dance Lab Room, 4th Floor, FPBS UPI Building. This activity continued the series of new student orientations at the faculty level, namely **MOKA Fakultas**, which had been conducted earlier.

During MOKA Fakultas, new students received various information about the environment and organizational structure of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS). They also obtained essential materials on the prevention and handling of sexual violence on campus. The event featured a parade of student associations from various study programs at FPBS, complete with performances from each association as a means of introducing student organizations.

Entering MOKAPRO, new students were invited to get to know the Arabic Language Education Study Program more closely. They were introduced to the lecturers and staff, the academic system, and other essential information related to coursework.

The program also presented outstanding scholarship recipients to share inspiring stories and experiences during their studies at PBA. They shared their academic journeys, organizational challenges, and strategies for achieving excellence and obtaining scholarships. Their presence is expected to provide tangible motivation for new students to be enthusiastic in their studies and actively participate in various self-development activities, both academic and non-academic.

Beyond sharing experiences, these outstanding students also showcased performances, including **qirā’atul akhbār** (news reading in Arabic) and **khiṭābah ‘arabiyyah** (public speaking in Arabic). These performances were not only an appreciation of their achievements but also a concrete illustration of the potential that new students can achieve through dedicated learning and active participation in student organizations.

One of the most engaging sessions was writing personal hopes from new students. They wrote their messages on sticky notes and posted them on an “aspiration board,” creating a warm and personal space that reflected their enthusiasm and high hopes for their academic journey at UPI.

Through this activity, new students are expected to feel more prepared, motivated, and develop a sense of belonging to the Arabic Language Education Study Program. This effort aligns with **SDG 4: Quality Education**, which emphasizes inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all.
