Yogyakarta, August 14, 2025 – Writing can be a simple, inexpensive, and effective means of self-healing. Through writing activities, individuals can relieve stress, reduce mental burdens, and channel emotions into productive creative works. This was highlighted in the event “Creative Writing Training as a Means of Self-Healing for Housewives: from Therapy to Poetry” held at the Pendopo Komunitas Akar Indonesia, Sleman, Yogyakarta, on Thursday (14/8).  

This event was part of a Community Service (PKM) program initiated by the PKM Team of the Indonesian Language and Literature Study Program (BSI), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), in collaboration with Komunitas Sastra Dewi Sartika (KSDS) West Java and Komunitas Akar Indonesia Yogyakarta.  

Previously, a similar program was held in Bandung on July 5, 2025. In the future, this PKM will involve a group of writers from South Korea, Changjak 21, and produce the poetry anthology *Three Cities Anthology: Bandung, Yogyakarta, and Seoul*, which is planned to be launched in November 2025.  

According to Nenden Lilis Aisyah, head of the PKM Team, lecturer, and writer, the program originated from concerns about various psychological issues faced by society, particularly housewives, in the era of digitalization and industrialization 5.0. Stress, mental pressure, depression, and domestic violence often become a double burden for women. “Through writing, outpourings of the heart do not stop as mere complaints, but can be processed into productive and positive works,” she explained.  

In addition to being a medium of expression, writing is also believed to provide physical benefits. “Writing by hand can improve heart health, stimulate endorphins, and support overall physical well-being,” Nenden added.  

The training participants, who were mostly housewives from various professional backgrounds, showed great enthusiasm throughout the entire event. The Chair of the Committee, Yostiani Noor Asmi Harini, emphasized that this activity also supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the areas of gender equality and mental health.  

The event opened with a unique performance from Komunitas Sastra Dewi Sartika, who presented the song *“Pagi Ceria”* (Cheerful Morning) composed by Katherina Achmad, using musical accompaniment made from everyday kitchen utensils. The excitement continued with material presentations by speakers Nenden Lilis Aisyah (UPI), Joni Ariadinata (Komunitas Akar Indonesia), and Yopi Setia Umbara (Buruan.co), moderated by Memen Durachman.  

Joni Ariadinata emphasized the importance of freedom of expression without being bound by theory, sharing the story of a housewife who became a writer through her daily experiences. Meanwhile, Yopi shared technical aspects of the creative process of writing poetry.  

The session was further enriched by a sharing session with KSDS writers who also acted as tutors: Eriyanti Nurmala Dewi, Heni Hendrayani, Katherina Achmad, Nuning Damayanti, and Shinta Kusumawati, who read their poems and explained their creative processes. The atmosphere became even warmer when participants were invited to join in the musicalization of the poem *“Serenade”* by Tetet Cahyati. The climax of the event was when participants practiced writing poetry as a means of self-healing and read their works aloud with deep emotion.  

The event was gracefully closed by Master of Ceremony Nevia Aufa Ramadiani. It is hoped that this activity can become a sustainable platform for housewives to discover new strength within themselves through writing.
