Bandung, August 19, 2025 — Another outstanding achievement was attained by a student of the Korean Language Education Study Program (PBK), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). Allisya Nur Azharia (2403967) won 1st Place (국회의원상 최우수상) at the prestigious 제29회 세계 한국어 웅변대회 (29th World Korean Speech Contest) held in Vietnam on August 14, 2025, defeating numerous participants from various countries.  

This achievement is clear evidence that UPI’s PBK students are capable of competing at the global level, both in academic mastery of the Korean language and in practical application. Allisya’s success also reflects the quality of education instilled by UPI in preparing graduates with strong international competitiveness.  

The international speech contest brought together participants from multiple countries, making Allisya’s victory not only a proud moment for UPI but also a positive representation of Indonesia on the global stage.  

This accomplishment is expected to inspire other students to continue honing their language skills and cultural understanding, while also expanding international networks. Thus, this success marks an important milestone in strengthening the contribution of Indonesia’s young generation in global forums.
