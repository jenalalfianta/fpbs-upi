The Japanese Language Education Study Program of FPBS UPI, through the Japanese Language Student Association (HIMABAJA), in collaboration with SOKENFEST, successfully held the 18th Japanzukishow on August 9â€“10, 2025. This annual event was particularly special as it coincided with the 60th anniversary of the Japanese Language Education Study Program. Japanzukishow 2025 became a celebration of Japanese culture and language, presented through various competitions, performances, and exhibitions involving participants from diverse backgrounds. This collaboration also aligns with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the areas of quality education, partnerships for the goals, and decent work opportunities.

On the first day, the series of events focused on various Japanese language competitions such as Speech Contest, Roudoku Kontesuto, Shuuji Kontesuto, Kana Kontesuto, Japanese Culture Quiz, and others. The participants came from high schools across Bandung City and West Java. Unlike previous years, the collaboration with SOKENFEST opened opportunities for participants from Vocational Training Institutions (LPK) and the general public to take part in certain competition categories. This brought a fresh atmosphere and expanded the reach of Japanzukishow to a more diverse community, supporting active public involvement in the development of cross-cultural skills.

The second day marked the peak of the celebration with competitions and entertainment themed around Japanese pop culture, such as Cosplay, Cover Song, and Seiyu Contest. The Japanzukishow stage became even livelier with performances from well-known Japanese culture enthusiast bands and groups in Indonesia, including Threesula, TomoAme, Twenty Nine Teens Ame Agari, and Thousand Sunny. A lineup of food stalls, merchandise booths, and typical Japanese trinkets attracted visitors' attention, along with a career consultation booth from SOKEN providing information on job opportunities in Japan. The enthusiasm of participants and visitors proved that Japanzukishow remains one of the largest and most anticipated Japanese cultural festivals of FPBS UPI. (Jeni Putra)
