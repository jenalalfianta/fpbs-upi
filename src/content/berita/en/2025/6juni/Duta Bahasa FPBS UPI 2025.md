**Bandung, June 2025** ‚Äî The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) has once again achieved a proud milestone at the *2025 West Java Language Ambassador* competition. This annual event is organized by the West Java Language Center under the auspices of the Language Development and Fostering Agency, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology.

This year, five FPBS UPI students made it to the final round after passing through a highly competitive selection process. The finalists were:
- **Icha Nur Octaviannisa** (Indonesian Language and Literature)  
- **Lisan Shidqi Zul Fahmi** (Alumnus of Sundanese Language Education)  
- **Nazwa Alaida Maharani** (Sundanese Language Education)  
- **Faiz Nasyith Hakim** (Arabic Language Education)  
- **Triya Fadhilah Dhianty Putri** (Alumna of Arabic Language Education)

In the grand final held on **June 21, 2025**, three of the five FPBS representatives won prestigious titles:
- üèÜ **Icha Nur Octaviannisa**: *2nd Place ‚Äì Female Category*  
- üèÖ **Lisan Shidqi Zul Fahmi**: *3rd Place ‚Äì Male Category & Audience Favorite*  
- üì± **Triya Fadhilah Dhianty Putri**: *Social Media Language Ambassador*

The West Java Language Ambassador competition is no ordinary contest. Participants are required to demonstrate fluency in three language domains: **Indonesian**, **regional languages**, and **foreign languages**. The selection stages included essay writing in all three languages, a foreign language proficiency test, the UKBI (Indonesian Language Proficiency Test), project proposal interviews (krida), psychological assessments, talent showcases, and public speaking evaluations before a panel of judges.

This year‚Äôs theme, **‚ÄúThe Dynamics of Language and Literature in the Development of Science and Technology,‚Äù** challenged finalists to think critically and creatively about linguistic issues in today‚Äôs global era. More than just a competition, the event served as a platform for personal development in leadership, cultural literacy, teamwork, and building networks with fellow youth, academics, and language enthusiasts.

The success of FPBS UPI students would not have been possible without the dedicated guidance of their faculty mentors, who provided intensive support throughout the process. This achievement stands as a testament to FPBS UPI‚Äôs commitment to fostering linguistic competence and preserving language and literature among the younger generation.

**Congratulations and thank you** to Icha, Lisan, and Triya, as well as their devoted mentors. May this achievement inspire the entire FPBS academic community to continue excelling, promoting cultural values, and honoring the university on the national stage.
