**Bandung, July 8, 2025**  
The Japanese Language Education Student Association (Himabaja) of FPBS Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia hosted a benchmarking visit from Himade, the Japanese Literature Student Association of Universitas Padjadjaran (UNPAD), on Tuesday, July 8, 2025. The activity took place on the FPBS UPI campus and was attended by the leadership teams of both student organizations.

The meeting aimed to foster a closer relationship between the two associations, which share a similar academic background. In a warm and collaborative atmosphere, both parties presented their organizational structures, flagship programs, and the challenges they face in managing student activities.

In addition to the discussion, the event included a campus tour of FPBS UPI, especially visits to the faculty’s flagship language learning facilities, such as language laboratories, multimedia rooms, and Smart Classrooms. This tour provided the UNPAD delegates with a firsthand look at the academic environment and infrastructure of the Japanese Language Education program at FPBS UPI.

The Himabaja chairperson emphasized the importance of such activities in expanding networks and fostering mutual inspiration:  
> “We are delighted to welcome our friends from Himade. This is a great opportunity to learn, share experiences, and hopefully build collaborations in the future, whether in work programs or academic and cultural activities.”

This visit highlighted the active role of students in building healthy and productive inter-campus networks while strengthening the values of cooperation and leadership. Furthermore, this initiative also supports the implementation of SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), by empowering students as agents of collaboration and organizational development in higher education.

Through this meaningful exchange, both Himabaja and Himade hope to maintain communication and pursue broader collaborative activities, such as joint seminars, competitions, training programs, or Japanese cultural events at the regional or national level.
