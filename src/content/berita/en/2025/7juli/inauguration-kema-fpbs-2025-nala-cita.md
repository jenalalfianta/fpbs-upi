**BANDUNG, FPBS UPI** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (FPBS UPI) continues to demonstrate its commitment to nurturing student leadership through student organization activities. One of the strategic agendas that supports this mission is the inauguration of the new board members of the FPBS Student Family (KEMA), held annually.

This year, the inauguration of KEMA FPBS for the 2025/2026 term took place on Friday, July 4, 2025, at Auditorium B, 4th Floor, FPBS UPI. The event was attended by the Vice Dean for Student Affairs, Mrs. Yanty Wirza, M.Pd., M.A., Ph.D., student organization advisors, heads of study programs, leaders of Student Activity Units (UKMF), heads of student associations, and representatives from other student organizations within UPI.

The event began with the solemn singing of the national anthem *Indonesia Raya*, *UPI Hymn*, and the *KEMA FPBS March*. This was followed by a recitation of the Holy Qur’an by Zaki Abdurrahman Syauqii, and opening remarks from Vice Dean for Student Affairs, Mrs. Yanty Wirza.

The inauguration ceremony continued with the reading of the Decree of the General Chairperson of KEMA FPBS UPI No. 001/A-SK/KEMA.FPBS/VII/2025 by Legio Rivahel Bonatua Sitanggang, the newly elected General Chairperson. The new board members then recited the inauguration script and took their oath of office.

The symbolic inauguration was marked by the conferring of sashes to the General Chairperson, General Secretary, and General Treasurer by Mrs. Yanty Wirza. The General Chairperson then continued the sash presentation to the heads of divisions and sub-divisions who will serve during the 2025/2026 administration.

To close the ceremony, Legio Rivahel Bonatua Sitanggang introduced the name of the 2025/2026 cabinet: “Nala Cita.” In Sanskrit, *Nala* means fire, spirit, and flame, while *Cita* means ideas, thoughts, and aspirations. The name reflects a “spirit that grows from various directions, united in one container, and continuously moves forward collectively.” This philosophy represents the collaborative energy and organizational vision for the year ahead. The official visual identity of the cabinet was also unveiled to symbolize a new spirit and refreshed institutional identity.
