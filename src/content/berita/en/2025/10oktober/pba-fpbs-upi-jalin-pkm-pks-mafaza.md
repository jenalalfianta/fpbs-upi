Garut, October 21, 2025 — The Arabic Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), conducted a Community Service (PKM) activity along with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Implementation Agreement (IA) with MAFAZA Indonesia Islamic Boarding School in Garut.

The event was officially opened by Dr. Asep Sopian, S.Pd., M.Ag., representing the Arabic Language Education Study Program of FPBS UPI, and welcomed by Rahmat, S.Si., Principal of MAFAZA Indonesia Junior High School. In their remarks, both parties emphasized the importance of synergy between universities and Islamic boarding schools in enhancing Arabic language learning and character education quality in the digital era.

As the keynote speaker, Dr. Mia Nurmala, M.Pd., delivered a presentation titled “Qur’an-Based Learning Methods in the Digital Era.” She highlighted the importance of making Qur’anic values the foundation for innovative, technology-based learning. Through this approach, students are expected to internalize Islamic values in adaptive and creative learning activities.

During the interactive discussion session, participants showed great enthusiasm, discussing various educational issues, including concerns about the negative effects of gadgets and social media on students’ character. Both lecturers and teachers agreed that strengthening digital literacy based on Qur’anic values should be a shared priority in educational settings.

In addition to the academic program, the nine-member delegation also promoted the Arabic Language Education programs, including the Special Achievement Admission Path for the Undergraduate (S1) Program and the hybrid class for the Master’s (S2) Program at UPI. The hybrid program is designed to provide flexibility for teachers and educators across regions to pursue further studies with greater convenience.

The highlight of the event was the signing of the MoU and IA covering the Tri Dharma of Higher Education—education, research, and community service. Through this collaboration, both institutions are committed to strengthening academic partnerships and improving the quality of Arabic language education in Islamic boarding schools and formal schools.

This activity is expected to serve as a concrete step in fostering stronger ties between universities and Islamic boarding schools, while reinforcing a shared vision to realize Arabic language education that is excellent, character-oriented, and grounded in Qur’anic values.
