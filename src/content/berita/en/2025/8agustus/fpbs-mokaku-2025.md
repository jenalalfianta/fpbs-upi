**Bandung, August 26, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), successfully organized the faculty-level Campus Orientation and General Lecture (*MOKAKU*) on Tuesday (26/8/2025) at the Ahmad Sanusi Multipurpose Building. This event was an important moment to welcome new FPBS UPI students for the 2025/2026 academic year, while instilling the spirit of togetherness, innovation, and leadership within the faculty environment.  

The event began with early morning preparations by the committee, followed by a briefing, as well as the conditioning and mobilization of participants to the main building. At exactly 07.00 WIB, the faculty-level MOKAKU series officially opened with remarks from the MC, recitation of the Qur’an, singing of the Indonesian national anthem and the UPI Hymn, a report from the Chief Organizer, a speech from the FPBS Student Council (KEMA) Chairperson, and welcoming remarks from the Dean of FPBS, **Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D.** On that occasion, the Dean emphasized that MOKAKU is a space for shaping the character of new students while fostering love for their alma mater.  

As a symbol of environmental care, new student representatives presented a tree to the Dean of FPBS. The agenda continued with the screening of the faculty profile video and presentations from the faculty leadership: the Dean outlined FPBS’s profile, Vice Dean I **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd.** explained academic affairs, and Vice Dean III **Yanty Wirza, M.Pd., M.A., Ph.D.** discussed student affairs. Meanwhile, Vice Dean II **Prof. Dr. Mohamad Zaka Al Farisi, M.Hum.** was unable to attend due to official duties.  

The program became even more meaningful with a session by the Head of UPI’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Handling Unit (SPPKS), **Dr. Hani Yulindrasari, S.Psi., M.Gendst., Ph.D.**, who delivered material on mental health and follow-up procedures in cases of harassment or hazing within the campus community. This was followed by an interactive discussion and Q&A session with new students.

Afterwards, participants were introduced to KEMA and the Student Associations (HIMA) within FPBS through profile videos, speeches, and mascot performances. The event was enlivened by creative performances from each student association, showcasing artistic talents and togetherness in a vibrant atmosphere.  

The event concluded with prayers, official closing remarks from the MC, and the mobilization of committee members and participants to their respective departmental MOKAKU activities. With the successful implementation of MOKAKU 2025, it is expected that new FPBS UPI students will quickly adapt, uphold academic values, and become a generation that is creative, of integrity, and ready to contribute to supporting **SDG 4 (Quality Education)** and **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)** through works and innovations in language and literature.
