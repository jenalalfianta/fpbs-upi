### Advocacy and Student Movement

The third session featured **Zaki Abdurrahman Syauqi** (*“Advocacy Management”*) and **Raqie Malik Syah** (*“The Urgency of Student Movements”*).  
Zaki explained that advocacy involves defending and supporting issues of injustice in a constructive, well-measured way.  
He outlined several steps in advocacy, such as understanding policies, identifying stakeholders, and ensuring that advocacy remains targeted and effective.  
> “Advocacy must be precise and strategic — we must avoid missteps in the bureaucratic process,” he remarked.

Meanwhile, Raqie discussed the **history and relevance of student movements** from Budi Utomo (1908) and the Youth Pledge (1928) to modern Indonesia.  
He cited **Ali ibn Abi Talib’s** quote:  
> “Injustice will persist, not because of the many wicked, but because of the silence of the good.”  
He urged students to stand against injustice and use digital platforms as a new space for activism.  
> “Indonesians spend over seven hours a day online — this is both a threat and an opportunity for student movements,” he noted.
