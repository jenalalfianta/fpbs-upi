**Bandung, September 7, 2025** – Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) once again achieved national recognition through **English Literature student, Zaenil Akmal Riwanto,** who won **National Champion** at the **National Intervarsity Climate and Energy Debating Championship (NICEDC) 2025** held at Bandung State Polytechnic. In addition to winning the team category, Zaenil also earned the individual title of **‘Best Speaker’.**  

UPI’s participation in this competition was officially supported by the institution through an assignment facilitated by the **Directorate of Student Affairs (Ditmawa).** This support reflects the university’s concrete role in providing opportunities for students to develop both academic and non-academic potential while strengthening UPI’s position as a campus that fosters innovation and sustainability.  

This achievement embodies the spirit of the **UPI Impact Program,** which encourages students to contribute meaningfully to addressing global issues. Through a debate competition focusing on climate and energy, Zaenil demonstrated the active role of UPI students in raising critical awareness of climate change issues. His success also reflects students’ ability not only to deeply understand environmental challenges but also to formulate strategic, innovative, and applicable solutions.  

Victory in this debating competition also supports the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),** particularly:  
- **SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)**  
- **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**  

The competition not only honed students’ communication skills but also fostered awareness of the importance of sustainable energy and climate change mitigation.  

Looking ahead, the **English Literature Study Program** is expected to actively encourage more students to participate in national and international competitions, while strengthening institutional support through permissions and financial assistance. These strategic steps are essential to ensure that student achievements become not only individual pride but also contributions to UPI’s reputation as one of Indonesia’s leading universities.
