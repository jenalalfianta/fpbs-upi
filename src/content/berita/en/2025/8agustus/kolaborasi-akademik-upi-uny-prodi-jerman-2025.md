- Curriculum benchmarking, to align and enrich the learning structure with industry needs and global developments.  
- Comparative study of the *Tourismus* course, which is one of the strengths and innovations in developing students' competencies.  
- Lecturer exchange programs, as a means to improve teaching quality and share academic experiences across institutions.  
- Collaboration in publishing scientific articles, both through journals managed by each program and joint research by lecturers.  

The Head of the German Language Education Study Program FPBS UPI stated that this visit was not only to exchange information but also to build concrete steps towards sustainable synergy.
