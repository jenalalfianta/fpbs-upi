Bandung, 8 February 2025 – Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) successfully held **UPI Open Visit 2025**, its first open house event aimed at introducing various study programs to prospective students. The event took place at the **UPI Gymnasium Building**, where multiple faculty booths were featured—including one from the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS).

As part of its promotional efforts, **FPBS students** actively distributed brochures, provided detailed explanations about the study programs, and answered questions from visiting high school students. The FPBS booth drew significant attention with its engaging and interactive activities, giving prospective students valuable insights into academic pathways in the fields of language and literature. In addition to Q&A sessions, FPBS also offered **exclusive souvenirs** to visitors who stopped by their booth as a token of appreciation for their interest.

To provide a hands-on experience, FPBS organized **four field trip sessions** that allowed participants to tour the faculty’s facilities. During these visits, participants were introduced to several of FPBS’s featured facilities, such as the Microteaching Lab, **Interpreting Lab, Language Lab, Podcast Room, Auditorium, Doctoral Examination Room**, and other supporting infrastructure.

Through this event, FPBS aimed to give prospective students a clear picture of the faculty’s academic environment, helping them feel more confident in choosing a study program that aligns with their interests and aspirations. **(Teja Mustika)**
