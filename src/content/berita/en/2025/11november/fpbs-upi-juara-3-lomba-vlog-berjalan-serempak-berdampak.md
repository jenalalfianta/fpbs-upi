Bandung, November 7, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) achieved 3rd Place in the “UPI Berjalan Serempak dan Berdampak” Vlog Competition, which was part of the series of events celebrating UPI’s 71st Anniversary.

The vlog competition involved various faculties and work units across UPI and aimed to document the spirit of togetherness and meaningful contributions toward creating a green, healthy, and sustainable campus. The FPBS team's vlog showcased a unique creative approach through the theme “UPI Asih, UPI Bersih,” combining educational value, collective spirit, and environmental awareness around the campus.

Through a dynamic and cheerful concept, the FPBS team successfully conveyed the main message of the activity — that cleanliness, health, and solidarity are integral elements of UPI’s academic community identity.

Dean of FPBS UPI, Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D., expressed his appreciation to the creative team for bringing pride to the faculty. “This achievement shows that the spirit of innovation and togetherness continues to thrive within FPBS. We are proud because this work not only showcases creativity but also reflects the sustainability values emphasized by the university,” he said.

This accomplishment further strengthens FPBS UPI’s commitment to supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), through activities that inspire and generate positive impacts on the academic environment.
