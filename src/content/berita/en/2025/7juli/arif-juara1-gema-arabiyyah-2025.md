**Bandung, May 16, 2025** — Arif Rahman Hakim once again achieved an outstanding accomplishment by winning 1st place at the 7th *Gema Karya Arabiyyah al-‘Alamiyyah*. The national-level competition was held by Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta on May 16, 2025, and featured participants from universities across Indonesia.

The competition focused on Arabic-language writing, speeches, and presentations addressing global issues, culture, and contemporary Islamic thought.

Arif presented a paper on the role of Arabic in strengthening cultural diplomacy—an original and highly relevant topic. His articulate and well-structured delivery earned him top marks from the judges.

Under the guidance of Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd. and Dr. Mia Nurmala, M.Pd., Arif underwent two months of intensive training prior to the competition. His success demonstrates the importance of integrating academic excellence with creativity to face global challenges.
