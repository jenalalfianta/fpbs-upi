**Bandung, September 17, 2025** – Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) officially launched the **Professional Education Strengthening Program (P3K)** at SMP Daarut Tauhiid Boarding School Putri. This program is part of the **Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM)** policy and an expansion of the **Educational Unit Field Introduction Program (PPLSP),** which has been upgraded from 4 credits to 20 credits.  

The P3K program aims to strengthen students’ competencies through contextual field practice. Guided by lecturers, students are directed to sharpen their academic, professional, and soft skills, making them more adaptive to the dynamics of education and industry demands.  

The handover ceremony of UPI P3K students took place on Wednesday (17/9), attended by **Principal of SMP Daarut Tauhiid Boarding School Putri, Rika Sinta Komara, M.Pd.,** along with teachers, **Field Supervising Lecturer Nalahuddin Saleh, M.Ag.,** and students from the **Arabic Language Education** and **Guidance and Counseling** study programs.  

The event began with an opening by **Mutia Hardianti, M.Pd.** as the MC, followed by a joint recitation of the Qur’an. Remarks from the school and supervising lecturer emphasized the importance of synergy between students, teachers, and the school in supporting teaching and learning activities.  

The program also included an introduction session between supervising teachers and students, as well as a Q&A session on technical implementation. As a form of commitment, the event concluded with the signing of a cooperation document between the school and UPI.  

The school expressed strong support for the implementation of P3K, hoping that students could make meaningful contributions to the school environment. Meanwhile, UPI emphasized that this program is a strategic platform for students to apply their knowledge while preparing themselves to become professional educators with global competitiveness and noble character.
