**Bandung, July 11, 2025** — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) has officially sent off eight students to participate in the Assistant Teacher Program in Australia. This initiative is part of UPI’s education internationalization efforts and a contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The students will teach Indonesian as a Foreign Language (BIPA) and introduce Indonesian culture at partner schools in Australia.

The participants come from various study programs, mostly from FPBS, with one student from the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) who will teach science. This highlights the interdisciplinary collaboration and the students' roles as agents of educational and cultural diplomacy.

The program is a collaboration between UPI, the Language Agency of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbudristek), the Education and Cultural Attaché of the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra, and several schools in Australia. Beyond academic experience, this program serves as a form of global community service by Indonesian students.

Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, Vice Dean I of FPBS, emphasized that the participants' mission is not only to teach, but also to carry the values and identity of Indonesia. With academic and cross-cultural preparation, the students are expected to perform professionally in multicultural environments.

This program directly contributes to SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), while empowering young people to play an active role in building a more tolerant and sustainable world through education and culture.
