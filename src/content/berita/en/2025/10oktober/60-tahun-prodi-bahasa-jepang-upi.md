Bandung, October 18, 2025 — The Japanese Language Education Study Program (PBJ), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), celebrated its 60th anniversary with the theme “Reflection on 60 Years of the Journey of the Japanese Language Education Study Program at UPI and Its Future Projection.”

Held at the FPBS UPI campus, the event was attended by FPBS Dean Wawan Gunawan, Ph.D., Vice Dean I Prof. Yulianeta, and Vice Dean III Yanty Wirza, Ph.D., along with the Head of the Japanese Language Education Study Program, Prof. Nuria Haristiani, M.Ed., Ph.D. Also present were faculty members, senior lecturers, alumni, and students. The event was also graced by international partner representatives, including Mr. Watase Yuya (World Nihongo Network), Mr. Inami Kazumi (Director General of The Japan Foundation Jakarta), as well as representatives from institutions such as AGBJI (Association of Japanese Language Teachers of Indonesia), IRIJJ (Institute Research Indonesia Japan Jakarta), OHM, Riki Japan, Bandung Japan Club, and Bandung Japan School.

Over six decades, the PBJ Study Program has produced thousands of teachers, lecturers, and Japanese language professionals who have contributed across various fields — from public and private schools, higher education institutions, and vocational training centers to industries and Japanese companies in both Indonesia and Japan.

The celebration also served as a cross-generational reunion, bringing together alumni from batches 1978 to 2021 in a warm and nostalgic atmosphere. The moment not only reflected the long academic journey of the PBJ Study Program but also strengthened collaboration networks across generations and institutions.

Through this event, the PBJ Study Program reaffirmed its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 4: Quality Education, by continuously strengthening international collaboration, developing culture-based learning, and enhancing students’ and graduates’ global competencies. With an innovative and sustainable spirit, the PBJ Study Program looks forward to the future as a leading center for Japanese language education in Indonesia, focusing on international collaboration, culture-based language learning, and global competence development.

This celebration served as both a reflection and an appreciation of six decades of academic achievements, as well as a moment to strengthen cooperation networks and look ahead to a sustainable, innovative, and globally competitive future for Japanese language education.
