**Bandung, September 19, 2025** – The Indonesian Language and Literature Education Study Program (PBSI), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), once again demonstrated its commitment to campus internationalization. This semester, PBSI FPBS UPI is hosting classes for eight international students from **Xi An International Studies University, China**, through the **Inbound Student Exchange Program**.  

The program is designed to provide foreign students with an immersive experience in learning the Indonesian language while also introducing them to the richness of Indonesian culture. Throughout the semester, students will receive lessons on linguistics, literature, and communication skills in Indonesian, integrated with culture-based activities.  

The Head of the Study Program, **Prof. Dr. Sumiyadi, M.Hum.,** emphasized that this initiative is a strategic step in supporting UPI’s vision as a *leading and outstanding university*. *“We hope that through this student exchange program, international students will not only study Indonesian academically but also understand the cultural values behind it. This knowledge exchange will strengthen UPI’s international academic network,”* he explained.  

This initiative also aligns with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly Goal 4 (*Quality Education*) and Goal 17 (*Partnerships for the Goals*). Through cross-border collaboration, the program is expected to strengthen Indonesia’s cultural diplomacy and open opportunities for joint research and international curriculum development.  

One of the students, **Zhao Zihan**, expressed enthusiasm: *“Studying Indonesian at UPI is very enjoyable. We can directly interact with lecturers and Indonesian students while also learning about Sundanese culture and the richness of Indonesian traditions,”* she said.  

Through this inbound student exchange program, PBSI FPBS UPI reaffirms its position as a center for Indonesian Language Learning for Foreign Speakers and expands the role of Indonesian higher education in the global arena.
