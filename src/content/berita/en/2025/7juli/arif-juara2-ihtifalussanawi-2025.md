**Bandung, June 21, 2025** — Arif Rahman Hakim, a student from the Arabic Language Education Program at UPI, has once again demonstrated consistent academic excellence. At the 57th *Ihtifalussanawi* event held at the Miftahussalam Islamic Boarding School Foundation, he secured 2nd Place at the Regional level.

The competition, held on June 21, 2025, is a prestigious annual event among pesantren (Islamic boarding schools) and Islamic institutions across West Java. *Ihtifalussanawi* serves as a platform to showcase Arabic language proficiency, particularly in speech, debate, and essay writing.

Arif delivered his speech with great confidence, presenting insightful ideas in fluent and eloquent *fusha* (formal Arabic). His performance reflected a high level of critical thinking and mastery of Arabic vocabulary.

His mentors, Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd., and Dr. Mia Nurmala, M.Pd., expressed their pride in Arif’s consistency in various competitions and his ability to adapt to different competition formats.

Student participation in *Ihtifalussanawi* is part of a broader initiative by the Arabic Language Education Program at UPI to strengthen soft skills and foster students’ talents and interests.
