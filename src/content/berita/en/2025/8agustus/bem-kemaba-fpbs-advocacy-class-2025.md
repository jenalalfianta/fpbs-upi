**Bandung, UPI – August 22, 2025** – The Student Executive Board of the Arabic Language Student Association (BEM KEMABA) FPBS UPI organized the Advocacy Class program on Friday, August 22, 2025, at Auditorium A, Faculty of Language and Literature Education, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). The event featured **Fairuz Azhar Hibatullah** as the main speaker with the theme *“Symphony of Aspirations: Knowing Rights, Paving Directions.”*  

The Advocacy Class is a flagship program of Qism Istisyarah (Advocacy Division) of BEM KEMABA FPBS UPI, aimed at increasing student awareness of their rights while equipping them with skills to voice aspirations intelligently and constructively.  

The event was attended by around 60 Arabic Language Education students, consisting of both committee members and participants. Throughout the program, activities ran smoothly and provided new perspectives on the importance of advocacy and sensitivity to the surrounding environment.  

In his presentation, **Fairuz Azhar Hibatullah** explained that advocacy is an effort to defend and fight for change toward justice and welfare through communication strategies and interventions with authorities in policymaking or decision-making. He also emphasized that advocacy has several stages to be effective, including:  

1. Identifying and understanding the problem.  
2. Setting objectives, such as policy changes, raising awareness, or halting harmful practices.  
3. Collecting data and conducting research.  
4. Identifying opportunities for collaboration.  
5. Preparing advocacy activities.  
6. Providing recommendations and planning strategies.  

In addition to discussing advocacy strategies, Fairuz also outlined the rights of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia students, which are obtained after fulfilling obligations such as tuition fee (UKT) payments. These rights include:  

1. **Educational and Special Services** – learning facilities and services for students with special needs.  
2. **Financial Support and Recognition** – scholarships, financial aid, and awards for achievements.  
3. **Facilities and Academic Freedom** – access to campus resources and responsible academic freedom.  
4. **Study Arrangements** – opportunities to accelerate study completion, take leave, or transfer programs according to regulations.  
5. **Organizations and Aspirations** – the right to join student organizations and express aspirations positively.  

Through this Advocacy Class, students were encouraged to understand how to properly advocate for their interests, ensuring that their rights are protected and exercised accordingly. This understanding is expected to foster students who are more critical, responsible, and capable of exercising their rights for a fair and balanced life.  

This effort also supports the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),** particularly **Goal 4 (Quality Education)** and **Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).**
