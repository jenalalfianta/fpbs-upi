**Bandung, UPI –** The Indonesian Language and Literature Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), held a guest lecture titled *“HOTS in Legend Reconstruction to Strengthen Disaster Literacy”* on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. The session featured **Prof. Dr. Sri Setyarini, M.A., App. Ling.**, affectionately known as Prof. Rini, a linguistics and literature expert from FPBS UPI.

Held in Classroom 01, 2nd Floor, the event ran from 08:40 to 10:20 AM. It was attended by students enrolled in the *Children’s Literature* course taught by **Dr. Yostiani N. A. Harini, M.Hum.** According to Dr. Yostiani, the session was crucial to raise students’ awareness about critical thinking through literary works while embedding disaster literacy values by creatively reconstructing traditional legends.

> “Literature is alive, beautiful, and full of expression. Through literature, we can express our anxieties, boredom, even our desire for change,” said Prof. Rini.

She emphasized literature as a tool to spark **Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)**, particularly in analysis (C4), evaluation (C5), and creation (C6).

In her presentation, Prof. Rini related literature to everyday life in a simple yet meaningful way. One example was: *“Why is bala-bala (a type of fritter) called bala-bala? Because it’s round in the front like a bala-bala.”* This humorous analogy encouraged students to think critically about language and meaning. *“People with HOTS don't just choose, they can explain the reason behind their choice,”* she added.

Prof. Rini also shared how traditional legends like **Sangkuriang** and **Rawa Pening** can be used to promote disaster awareness. *“From folklore, we can understand the cause-and-effect of disasters and recognize the importance of environmental responsibility,”* she explained.

Moreover, Prof. Rini stressed that literacy should not stop at reading texts—it must also involve critical thinking and problem-solving. *“Stories are not just tales. They must have direction, purpose, and move readers to think and feel.”*

This activity aimed to inspire and strengthen disaster literacy through legend reconstruction. It also served as an inspiration for students to develop children’s literature as a critical, creative, and contextual educational medium.
