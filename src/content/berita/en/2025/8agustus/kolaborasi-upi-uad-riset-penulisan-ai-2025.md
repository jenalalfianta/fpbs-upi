Bandung, August 19, 2025 — The Korean Language Education Study Program, FPBS Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), has established a strategic collaboration with the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education (FKIP), Universitas Ahmad Dahlan (UAD) Yogyakarta.  

This collaboration was marked by a Community Service Program (PkM) entitled *“Training on Research and Scientific Article Writing Assisted by AI Technology in the FKIP Universitas Ahmad Dahlan Environment.”* The program was conducted online on June 11 and 18, 2025, involving nearly 40 enthusiastic students who participated in discussions on research and academic writing supported by artificial intelligence technology.  

The collaboration was further strengthened through an offline meeting at the FKIP UAD Campus on August 14, 2025, where both institutions officially signed a memorandum of cooperation. This signing became the starting point for the establishment of joint research networks, collaborative scientific publications, and cross-campus community service programs.  

More than just an academic activity, this synergy between UPI and UAD represents a shared commitment to strengthening research capacity, leveraging technological innovation, and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the areas of quality education, innovation, and partnerships.  

This collaboration is expected to serve as a sustainable foundation for building an inclusive, innovative, and globally competitive research ecosystem, providing real benefits for education and the wider community.
