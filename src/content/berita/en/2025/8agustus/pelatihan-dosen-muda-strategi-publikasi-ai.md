Bandung, August 6, 2025 â€“ The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia held a Young Lecturer Training, featuring Dr. Ju Seong Lee from The Education University of Hong Kong as the keynote speaker. The event took place in the FPBS UPI Doctoral Promotion Room.

The event was opened and moderated by FPBS Vice Dean for Student Affairs, Yanty Wirza, M.Pd., M.A., Ph.D., who emphasized the importance of strengthening the capacity for scientific publications among young lecturers, particularly to enhance competitiveness at the international level.

In the training session titled *Publishing with Impact: Navigating High-Quality Journals in the AI Era*, Dr. Lee presented strategic steps for writing and publishing scientific articles in reputable journals. The materials included:

- The use of the IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) to strengthen article structure.
- Techniques for identifying a research gap and presenting it in the research background.
- Choosing the right research design (experimental, quasi-experimental, and non-experimental).
- Strategies to enhance research validity through data and method triangulation.
- Common mistakes that lead to manuscript rejection by international journal editors.
- Integrating research impact so that research results influence policy, education, and society at large.

Dr. Lee also emphasized that publication in the AI era requires researchers to produce knowledge that is not only theoretically new but also relevant to real-world needs. This approach aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:  
- **SDG 4**: Quality Education, by improving lecturers' capacity to produce high-quality research.  
- **SDG 9**: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, by encouraging innovation in research methods and the use of AI technology.  
- **SDG 17**: Partnerships for the Goals, through international collaboration between UPI and The Education University of Hong Kong.  

This training is expected to equip young FPBS UPI lecturers with greater confidence to publish in reputable scientific journals, so that their academic contributions can have a real impact on society and sustainable development. *(Teja Mustika)*
