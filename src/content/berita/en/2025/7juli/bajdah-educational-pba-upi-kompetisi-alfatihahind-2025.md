**Bandung, UPI – July 15, 2025** – Bajdah Educational, in collaboration with the Arabic Language Education Study Program (PBA) of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), and *Al-Fatihah.Ind*, launched the **National Competition for Introducing the Al-Fatihah.Ind Tahsin Application**. The competition runs from July 15 to October 15, 2025, and is open to teachers, lecturers, institutional leaders, and inspirational preachers across Indonesia. Participants are expected to play a key role in promoting tahsin technology through the *Al-Fatihah.Ind* application, available on Google Play and the App Store.  

During the competition, participants are required to introduce the application to an audience through video, encourage audiences to download the app, try the automatic correction feature, and obtain a certificate of mastery for Surah Al-Fatihah. They must also create creative social media content using the official hashtags: **#SertifikatBacaAlfatihah, #KoreksiAlfatihah, #TahsinAlfatihah, #BajdahEducational, and #AlfatihahInd**.  

Evaluation criteria include innovation in promotion, social media engagement, the number of Al-Fatihah certificates uploaded, and creativity in video content. Compliance with hashtag usage is also a crucial part of the assessment. Further information is available on Instagram **@arabupi_edu** and social media **@Alfatihah.Ind**.  

The competition offers a total prize of **IDR 20,000,000** for 10 winners, with each winner receiving **IDR 2,000,000** in cash and an international award certificate.  

Through this initiative, Bajdah Educational and PBA UPI aim to promote the use of digital technology to improve the quality of Qur’anic recitation, particularly Surah Al-Fatihah, and to expand tahsin literacy through application-based learning. This effort aligns with **SDG 4: Quality Education**, emphasizing inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all.
