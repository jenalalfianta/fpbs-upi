**BANDUNG** – Aware of the need for a space of expression among housewives, the Indonesian Language and Literature Study Program (Prodi BSI) of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), in collaboration with the Dewi Sartika Literary Community (KSDS), held a workshop titled *"Literary Appreciation Workshop through Creative Writing as a Medium of Self-Healing for Housewives: From Therapy to Poetry."* This community service activity (PkM) was held joyfully last Friday (July 5, 2025) at the Smart Class Room, 4th Floor, Building B, FPBS UPI.

The workshop responded to the phenomenon of housewives often trapped in daily routines with limited space to express themselves and care for their mental health. The event’s coordinator, Dr. Yostiani Noor Asmi Harini, M.Hum., emphasized that housewives often have to carry burdens alone. They sacrifice for their families, yet are often seen as weak, leading to frequent domestic violence. Through a literary approach, particularly poetry writing, participants were encouraged to honestly express their feelings, experiences, and hidden hopes. The creative writing process was positioned as a medium for self-healing or emotional recovery.

> “Literature, especially poetry, can be a medium or safe space for mothers to voice their hearts and take care of themselves,” said Nenden Lilis Aisyah, a BSI lecturer and workshop speaker.

The event featured a special performance of poetry musicalization using household items such as plates, spoons, and bottles. This innovation not only added creative and fun elements, but also symbolically brought literature closer to the everyday lives of participants. The atmosphere became warmer and more relaxed.

This activity successfully demonstrated that literature can be present in a relevant way in daily life. *"Not only to be appreciated, literature can actually become a simple yet meaningful tool for self-healing. We hope the spirit and skills gained can continue to be applied by the participants at home,"* concluded a representative from the Dewi Sartika Literary Community. In addition to learning creative writing, the attending housewives also felt a renewed sense of togetherness and enthusiasm in their daily roles.
