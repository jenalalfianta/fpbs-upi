Yogyakarta, August 14, 2025. In order to strengthen the quality of education and the capacity of junior and senior high school teachers, a team of eight lecturers from the English Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), will hold a community service program (PkM) entitled “From Design to Deep Learning.” The event will take place on August 14–15, 2025, in Yogyakarta, in collaboration with the English Subject Teachers’ Working Group (MGMP) of Bantul Regency.  

The program will involve dozens of teachers from various secondary schools in Bantul Regency and will be facilitated by UPI academics together with local education partners. Its main focus is to introduce deep learning approaches aligned with the mandate of the National Curriculum, through dialogic reflection sessions, public lectures, and pedagogical practices based on technology and transformative values.  

This initiative is a continuation of a series of PkM activities that began online in June 2025, starting with reflective dialogues among educators as an initial exploration, followed by public lectures attended by more than 150 teachers online from Bantul and Yogyakarta. Topics discussed include: (1) reflection-based classroom assessment, (2) transformative teaching practices, (3) the development of activities and materials based on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), and (4) the integration of technology, pedagogy, and content (TPACK).  

In addition to strengthening teacher capacity, this activity also represents UPI’s contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly: (1) SDG 4: Quality and inclusive education, and (2) SDG 17: Strategic partnerships for sustainable development.  

The program is expected to become a model for sustainable partnerships between universities and local education communities, while also strengthening UPI’s role as a university committed to inclusive, effective, and impactful educational transformation.
