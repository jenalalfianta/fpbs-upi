**Bandung, September 19, 2025** – The **Teacher Professional Experience Enhancement Program (P3K)** was officially launched in collaboration with **SDIT Luqmanul Hakim** as a strategic partner. This program reflects the university’s commitment to improving the competencies of prospective teachers while supporting the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),** particularly Goal 4: *Quality Education*.  

The P3K program provides students with the opportunity to engage directly in educational practice, interact with pupils, and apply educational theories learned on campus. Under the guidance of SDIT Luqmanul Hakim teachers, students not only hone their teaching skills but also learn to build an inclusive, innovative, and character-oriented learning environment.  

**Juliani, S.Pd.,** Principal of SDIT Luqmanul Hakim, expressed appreciation for this collaboration, noting that the presence of P3K students has brought fresh perspectives to the learning process, introduced creative methods, and fostered literacy and numeracy enthusiasm among pupils.  

Meanwhile, field supervisor **Shofa Musthafa Khalid, M.Pd.,** emphasized that student participation in this program represents the implementation of the **Tri Dharma of Higher Education.** *“Through P3K, students can strengthen their pedagogical, social, and professional competencies. This is also aligned with the SDGs agenda to improve the quality of education from basic to higher levels,”* he stated.  

The program also underscores the importance of cross-institutional collaboration to build an excellent generation. This initiative is expected to address global challenges in providing equitable, relevant, and sustainable education.  

With a spirit of collaboration and innovation, the Teacher Professional Experience Enhancement Program with SDIT Luqmanul Hakim stands as a concrete step toward realizing quality, inclusive, and equitable education for all.
