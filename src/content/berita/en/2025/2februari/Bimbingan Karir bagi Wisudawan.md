The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) held a Career Coaching event for Batch 1 graduates on 18 February 2025. The event took place in the FPBS Doctoral Promotion Meeting Room and aimed to equip graduates with insights and strategies for entering the professional world. The session began with an opening, followed by a welcome speech from the Vice Dean for Student Affairs of FPBS, who emphasized the importance of early career preparation.

Participants then received presentations from two main speakers who are experts in career development and academic advancement:

1. **Dr. Rinaldi Supriadi, M.Pd.** – He delivered a session on Ethics and Professionalism in the Workplace, the importance of networking, and career exploration strategies based on one’s field of study. He also explained how graduates can develop short- and long-term career plans and prepare themselves through training, certifications, and relevant work experience.

2. **Hasna Fathina (Representative of BKPK UPI)** – She discussed the significance of the Tracer Study for both alumni and the institution. The Tracer Study is used to map graduates' career paths and improve educational quality at UPI. Graduates were encouraged to complete the Tracer Study through UPI's official platform to support academic program evaluation and development.

The event concluded with a lively Q&A session. Participants asked a variety of questions regarding workplace challenges, strategies to land their dream jobs, and how to maximize job search platforms such as LinkedIn and Jobstreet. The activity ended with high hopes that FPBS graduates will be more prepared to face the professional world and build careers aligned with their areas of expertise. **(Teja Mustika)**
