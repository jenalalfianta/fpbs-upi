The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) proudly hosted a Visiting Professor program featuring **Prof. Mukhamad Najib, M.Si.**, a professor from IPB University and former Education and Cultural Attaché of the Republic of Indonesia in Canberra (2021–2024). This event aimed to share valuable experiences with students about the BIPA (Indonesian Language for Foreign Speakers) teaching assistant program in Australia and to encourage lecturers to motivate their students to participate in similar programs through the Indonesian Education and Cultural Attaché in Canberra.

Held on Thursday, 20 February 2025 at the FPBS Auditorium, the event began with an opening ceremony and the singing of the Indonesian national anthem. The Dean of FPBS then delivered welcoming remarks, expressing appreciation for Prof. Najib’s presence and his willingness to share international academic insights.

As a token of appreciation, FPBS presented a souvenir to Prof. Najib, which he reciprocated with a symbolic gift of a book for FPBS.

In the main session, **Prof. Mukhamad Najib, M.Si.** delivered an inspiring presentation about his experiences as both an academic and an education diplomat. He shared insights into the BIPA teaching assistant program in Australia, strategies for academic development in global contexts, and opportunities for students to participate in international programs such as teaching practicums (PPL) abroad.

A highlight of the event was the screening of a video showcasing student activities during their teaching practicum in Australia. The video featured experiences shared by three students—**Hanifa Nuraini, Ivena Winri Al Madinah Tunnisa, and Rayhan Mirza Aulia**—who reflected on the challenges and benefits of the program. This was followed by an engaging discussion and reflection session, where both students and faculty had the opportunity to ask questions and interact directly with Prof. Najib and the returning student participants.

The Visiting Professor event concluded with closing remarks and hopes for greater international academic collaboration at FPBS, along with increased student participation in the BIPA teaching assistant program in Australia. **(Teja Mustika)**
