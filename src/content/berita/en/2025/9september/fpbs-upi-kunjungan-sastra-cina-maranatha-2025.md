**Bandung, September 25, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), made its first visit to the **Chinese Literature Study Program at Maranatha Christian University**. This visit marked the initiation of an academic partnership and was part of the preparation for establishing a new **Mandarin Language and Culture Study Program at FPBS UPI**.  

The UPI delegation was led by **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd.** (Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Quality Assurance), accompanied by **Yanti Wirza, M.Pd., M.A., Ph.D.** (Vice Dean for Student Affairs and Partnerships), along with **Amirush Shaffa Fauzia, S.Pd., M.Pd.** and student **Icha Nur Octavianissa**. They were warmly welcomed by **Dr. Pauw Budianto, S.T., M.Si., M.Lit.** (Head of the Chinese Literature Study Program) and **Noviana Laurencia, B.A., M.Lit.** (lecturer of the Mandarin Diploma Program).  

During the academic forum, both institutions emphasized the importance of thorough preparation in opening a new study program to meet global needs. **Curriculum development** was highlighted as a priority, as it must align with international standards while remaining relevant to the Indonesian context. Interactive, technology-based, and communication-oriented teaching methods were also considered essential to encourage students to actively master the language rather than passively.  

Furthermore, the qualifications of teaching staff were highlighted as a key determinant of educational quality, with an emphasis on strong academic backgrounds and practical experience in teaching Mandarin.  

One crucial point raised by Maranatha Christian University was the **graduate competency standard targeting at least HSK 5 and HSKK.** This benchmark is significant as an objective measure of students’ Mandarin proficiency at the international level. Achieving this standard is expected to enhance graduates’ competitiveness both in the job market and in global academia.  

This visit was not limited to academic discussions but also served as the beginning of efforts to expand networks, strengthen research collaboration, and build cultural diplomacy between Indonesia and China. This initiative supports UPI’s commitment to **SDG 4 (Quality Education)** in improving educational standards and **SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals)** through strategic inter-university collaboration. It is expected that this program will deliver a tangible impact on education quality and bilateral relations.
