Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) inaugurated the Japan Corner at the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) UPI. The inauguration was officiated by UPI Rector Prof. Dr. H. Didi Sukyadi, M.A., together with donors from the World Nihongo Network (WNN) — Mr. Yuya Watase, Mr. Masatoshi Ishikawa, Mr. Mitsunori Yanai — and the Director General of The Japan Foundation Jakarta, Mr. Inami Kazumi.

The event was attended by Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd. (Vice Rector for Human Resources and Information Systems), Prof. Dr. Rudi Susilana, M.Si. (Vice Rector for Planning and Finance), FPBS Dean Wawan Gunawan, Ph.D., Vice Dean I Prof. Yulianeta, and Vice Dean III Yanty Wirza, Ph.D. Also present were the Head of the Japanese Language Education Study Program, Prof. Nuria Haristiani, M.Ed., Ph.D., along with faculty members, alumni, and invited guests from various partner institutions such as AGBJI (Association of Japanese Language Teachers of Indonesia), IRIJJ (Institute Research Indonesia Japan Jakarta), OHM, Riki Japan, Bandung Japan Club, and Bandung Japan School.

The Japan Corner was established as a hub for cultural exchange and education aimed at fostering strong relations between Indonesia and Japan while serving as a space for Japanese cultural learning. It features a traditional tea ceremony room (chanoyu) and various cultural artifacts such as kimono, yukata, traditional musical instruments (koto and taishogoto), and the traditional dolls hinaningyou. Visitors can experience the authentic atmosphere of Japanese culture within the campus environment.

This initiative supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 4: Quality Education and Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals, by strengthening international collaboration, broadening students’ multicultural perspectives, and nurturing sustainable cross-cultural understanding.

The inauguration of the Japan Corner marks a strategic step by UPI in creating an educational and inspirational space that integrates academic values, culture, and international diplomacy.

As part of the event series, attendees were treated to a captivating performance of the traditional Japanese musical instrument, the Koto (琴), played by Risa Togo. Risa-san, a teacher at Bandung Japan School, has a special connection with UPI as she previously studied at the university for one year. The gentle melody of the Koto added a solemn and authentic atmosphere to the Japanese cultural ambiance presented during the inauguration ceremony.
