**Bandung, September 16, 2025** – Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), through the **Arabic Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS),** officially established a strategic partnership with **SMP Darul Hikmah**, located at Jln. Sariwangi No. 81, Sariwangi Village, Parongpong District. This collaboration aims to strengthen the implementation of **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education**.  

The signing ceremony of the **Implementation Agreement** and **Cooperation Agreement** was held on Monday (16/9). The agreement was signed by **H. Dadang, M.Pd.,** Principal of SMP Darul Hikmah, and **Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D.,** Dean of FPBS UPI. Although the signing was conducted separately, the event was directly observed by students of the Arabic Language Education Study Program as part of contextual learning.  

One concrete result of this partnership is the launch of the **Teacher Professional Experience Enhancement Program (P3K)** at SMP Darul Hikmah. The program is designed to provide students with a comprehensive experience in various aspects of education, not only classroom teaching but also school administration, curriculum development, and involvement in non-academic activities.  

The P3K program will run for a full semester during the 2025/2026 academic year, from September to December. During this period, students will have the opportunity to assist teachers in class, manage administrative tasks, and participate in school activities, including extracurricular development, religious events, national celebrations, and student character-building programs.  

According to the Arabic Language Education Study Program of FPBS UPI, this collaboration is part of the implementation of the **Tri Dharma of Higher Education**—education, research, and community service. It is expected to strengthen functional relations between universities and schools, ensuring that theoretical knowledge gained on campus can be applied in real-world contexts.  

Dean of FPBS UPI, **Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D.,** emphasized: *“Through the P3K program, students are not only learning theory in class but also testing their abilities directly in schools. SMP Darul Hikmah will serve as a field laboratory, allowing students to apply their academic knowledge in real-life contexts.”*  

Principal of SMP Darul Hikmah, **H. Dadang, M.Pd.,** welcomed the collaboration: *“We truly appreciate the presence of UPI students in our school. Their involvement will bring fresh perspectives for both students and teachers. With their participation in teaching and school activities, we expect added value that will enhance the quality of education at SMP Darul Hikmah.”*  

Through this collaboration, UPI and SMP Darul Hikmah are optimistic about making a significant contribution to improving the quality of secondary education. The program is also believed to accelerate the achievement of **SDG 4**, particularly in ensuring equitable access to education, improving the quality of educators, and enriching students’ learning experiences at the junior high school level.  

Beyond strengthening academic partnerships, the program is also expected to provide dual benefits: FPBS UPI students gain valuable professional experience, while SMP Darul Hikmah receives additional support in managing teaching and school development activities.
