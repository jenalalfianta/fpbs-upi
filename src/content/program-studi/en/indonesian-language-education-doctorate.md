              <p>The course assessment system at UPI refers to UPI's Educational Implementation Guidelines. The assessment in master’s and doctoral programs is designed to evaluate student achievement over a semester. Six assessment aspects include principles, techniques and instruments, mechanisms and procedures, implementation, reporting, and graduation. The principles combine educational, authentic, objective, accountable, and transparent values. Techniques include observation, participation, achievement, written/oral tests, and surveys.</p>

              <p>Assessment covers both learning process and outcomes. It includes formative assessment for learning improvement and summative assessment for measuring achievement of Learning Outcomes (LO). Formative assessment is conducted during the course with feedback; summative via mid-terms and final exams.</p>

              <p>The form of assessment depends on the learning model. In project-based models, assessment as learning is prioritized. Students are assessed on cognitive, attitude, general, and specific skills through projects, participation, and tasks. Self and peer assessments are also applied.</p>

              <p>Competencies and their weights are planned in the RPS via SPOT system. Cognitive assessed via papers/presentations; attitude via group activities and indicators like leadership and collaboration.</p>

              <p>Students absent during exams due to illness must provide medical proof to retake exams. More than three absences mean ineligibility for exams and must retake the course. Remedials only apply for content subjects. Scores are managed via SInNDo. Lecturers must transparently provide raw scores access.</p>

              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>Attitude: observation. Knowledge and skills: combined techniques. Final score integrates all instruments.</li>

              <p>Learning in the master's program of Indonesian Language Education is carried out in a moderate, communicative, comfortable, independent, and disciplined atmosphere.

              <p>To ensure learning runs smoothly, students must be enrolled in the course list through a contract. Mistakes in enrollment can be corrected through PRS.</p>

              <p>Lecturers and students must fill out the Lecture Report (BAP). Students with less than 80% attendance cannot take the exam. Schedule changes must be coordinated with the program for rescheduling.</p>
