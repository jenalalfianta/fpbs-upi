**Bandung, June 4, 2025** — To improve the quality of organized and systematic archive management in line with university standards, the **Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS)** at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia held a **Technical Workshop on Archive Management** over two days in collaboration with the UPI Archives Office.

The workshop, held on **Tuesday and Wednesday, June 3–4, 2025**, took place in the **3rd Floor Meeting Room of FPBS UPI** and was attended by Heads of Study Programs, Section Heads, and educational staff from the **Processing Units (UP)** and **Archival Unit II (UK II)** within FPBS.

### Understanding Archival Structures and SOPs

On the first day, participants received key materials regarding archival policies and practices based on **UPI Rector’s Decree No. 20/UN40/KA.00.00/2025**. The sessions were led by **Dr. Rasto, M.Pd.**, who discussed archiving strategies within the context of bureaucratic accountability, and **Asep Mulyana, S.A.P., M.Pd.**, who explained technical document management within processing units.

Key topics covered included:

- Strategic roles of Processing Units and Archival Unit II  
- The organizational structure of archives at UPI  
- 12 main tasks of Processing Units  
- Implementation of key SOPs such as Official Document Procedures and Archive Retention Schedules  

Participants were guided through the concepts of active and inactive archives, including how to organize, store, and systematically transfer vital documents to the archival unit.

### Field Visits and Implementation Evaluation

On the second day, the UPI Archives team conducted **direct visits to each Processing Unit** within FPBS. These visits aimed to monitor the implementation of archive management in practice and provide hands-on technical assistance.

Findings from the visits showed that most units had a solid understanding of archival principles. However, some areas for improvement were identified, including the need to compile active archive lists, submit regular reports, and enhance capacity in classification and retention procedures.

### Recommendations and Follow-Up

As a conclusion to the activity, the UPI Archives team provided several strategic recommendations, including:

- Systematic compilation of active archive lists in each unit  
- Regular reporting of inactive archive transfers  
- Follow-up training on classification and transfer of vital archives  
- Periodic monitoring at least twice a year  

Through this workshop, FPBS hopes all work units will be able to implement archive management practices that **align with university regulations and the principles of good public administrative governance**. A shared commitment to regular reporting and document transfer will be an important step toward **sustainable and compliant archival management**.
