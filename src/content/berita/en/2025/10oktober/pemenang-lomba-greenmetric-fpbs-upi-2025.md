Bandung, October 31, 2025 — The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, officially announced the winners of the FPBS GreenMetric 2025 Competition as a form of appreciation for study programs that have actively contributed to maintaining and beautifying the faculty’s environment. This event is part of the implementation of FPBS ASRI (Area Sejuk, Rimbun, dan Indah – Cool, Lush, and Beautiful Area), derived from the UI GreenMetric program and UPI’s initiative to create a healthy, green, and sustainable campus.

The competition reflects FPBS’s commitment to applying the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within higher education. Each study program was given the opportunity to showcase innovation and creativity in developing green spaces, enhancing vertical gardens, and creating comfortable, supportive environments for academic activities. The assessment covered several aspects, including aesthetics, cleanliness, creativity, teamwork, and consistency in maintaining the established gardens.

The evaluation process took place throughout October 2025, conducted by a panel of judges consisting of faculty leaders, representatives from UPI’s GreenMetric team in the Setting Infrastructure division, the FPBS GreenMetric team, and student representatives. All study programs demonstrated high enthusiasm and engaged in a healthy competition to present the best version of their green areas.

After a thorough assessment process, the final results of the FPBS GreenMetric 2025 Competition are as follows:

1. 1st Place: Sundanese Language Education Study Program  
2. 2nd Place: Indonesian Language and Literature Education Study Program
