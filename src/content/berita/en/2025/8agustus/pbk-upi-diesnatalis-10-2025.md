Bandung, August 17, 2025 – The Korean Language Education Study Program (PBK), Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), celebrated its 10th Anniversary with great festivity at the Ahmad Sanusi Hall (BPU) UPI. Although the official anniversary date of PBK fell on August 5, the celebration was held on Indonesia’s Independence Day, August 17, 2025, adding to the joy and meaning of togetherness.  

The event was attended by the PBK FPBS UPI academic community, students, alumni, and invited guests. The series of activities included remarks from the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd.; a committee report by Velayeti Nurfitriana Ansas, M.Pd.; a video presentation featuring greetings from the Rector of UPI, FPBS leadership, all study programs, alumni, and students; the symbolic cutting of *tumpeng*; and performances from each student cohort.  

This one-decade milestone served as a reflection of PBK FPBS UPI’s journey in producing quality graduates, developing research, and expanding academic networks both nationally and internationally. The Head of the PBK Study Program emphasized that the achievements over these 10 years were the result of the synergy of the entire academic community and the support of collaborative partners.  

Beyond being a birthday celebration, this event also strengthened solidarity, fostered new enthusiasm, and reaffirmed PBK FPBS UPI’s commitment to continue making an impact on Indonesian education, language research, and the strengthening of Indonesia–Korea cultural relations.
