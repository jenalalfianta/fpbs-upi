The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) welcomed five exchange students from La Rochelle University, France. The welcoming event took place in the first-floor meeting room of the FPBS Building and was attended by the Dean of FPBS, Vice Deans, and the Head of the French Language Education Study Program.

The five students participating in the exchange program are:

1. Annaëlle Aubry  
2. Youenn Rollin  
3. Maiwen Bourc’his  
4. Jade Huet  
5. Amalia Leroy

Also present at the event was **Chirine Fatna Aboufalah**, a native-speaking lecturer from La Rochelle University, who had arrived earlier in Indonesia to support the academic activities of the exchange program at FPBS.

The event began with an introduction to FPBS, during which the students were familiarized with the various study programs, facilities, and the academic environment of the faculty. This was followed by self-introductions from each La Rochelle student, where they shared their initial impressions of Indonesia and Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia.

As part of the agenda, the Head of the French Language Education Program also provided an overview of the curriculum and academic activities in the program, giving the students a clear picture of the learning system they would experience throughout the exchange period.

Beyond academic introductions and discussions, FPBS also presented official university blazers to the exchange students as a symbolic gesture of their inclusion in the UPI academic community. The students enthusiastically welcomed the blazers, viewing them as a meaningful token of their participation in the program.

Through this exchange initiative, FPBS hopes to foster meaningful cultural and academic exchange that enriches both the La Rochelle students and FPBS students. This program represents a tangible example of the international collaborations continuously developed by FPBS in its effort to advance the internationalization of education. **(Teja Mustika)**
