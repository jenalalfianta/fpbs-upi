Yogyakarta, August 14, 2025 – The English Education Study Program of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) strengthened its role in supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a Community Service Program (PKM) entitled *“Integrating Deep Learning, Genre-Based Approach, and Technology in English Language Teaching.”* This activity was carried out in collaboration with the English Education Study Program of Universitas PGRI Yogyakarta (UPY) as a partner and served as a concrete contribution to supporting SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  

The training was held at the Executive Room of the Management Study Program, 2nd Floor, UPY Unit 1, attended by lecturers of UPY’s English Education Study Program as well as representatives from Universitas Mercu Buana Yogyakarta, Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana, Universitas Islam Mulia, and Universitas Sarjanawiyata Taman Siswa. The goal was to strengthen lecturers’ competencies in implementing deep, contextual, and 21st-century-relevant learning through the Genre-Based Approach (GBA) and the use of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI).  

Head of UPY’s English Education Study Program, Dr. Mohammad Iskandar Dzulkurnain, M.Pd., expressed his appreciation for this partnership, which he considered a strategic step to improve the quality of teacher education. Meanwhile, Prof. Fuad Abdul Hamied, M.A., Ph.D., from UPI emphasized that Deep Learning is not only focused on academic achievement but also on shaping prospective teachers with social, emotional, and spiritual resilience, in line with SDG 4 on improving technological and pedagogical skills.  

The training sessions began with a panel discussion by Prof. Fuad and Prof. Dr. Nenden Sri Lengkanawati, M.Pd., followed by collaborative workshops that included deep reading with the GBA approach presented by Prof. Emi Emilia, M.Ed., Ph.D.; deep writing delivered by Dr. Sudarsono MI, S.Pd., M.A.; and technology integration, including AI, presented by Dr. Finita Dewi, M.A. Participants also engaged in group discussions to design lessons integrating Deep Learning, GBA, and technology.  

According to the Head of UPI’s English Education Study Program, Prof. Emi Emilia, this partnership is a concrete implementation of SDG 17, which encourages cross-institutional collaboration to share knowledge, innovations, and best practices in English language teaching. She hopes this collaboration can continue in the form of joint research, curriculum development, and other academic programs.  

Through this PKM, the UPI English Education Study Program reaffirms its commitment to advancing quality education, expanding access to learning technologies, and building impactful partnerships that contribute to human resource development in the field of English language education in Indonesia.
