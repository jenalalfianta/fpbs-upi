**Brunei Darussalam, 24–28 May 2025** — A delegation of students from the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) achieved a proud milestone at the 4th *Memperkasa Pantun Nusantara*, an international cultural event held at Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Brunei Darussalam. In the inter-country pantun competition, the FPBS UPI team emerged as **First Place winners**, marking a significant cultural diplomacy success for Indonesia through the art of oral literature.

Performing under the theme **“Senyum Serumpun, Suara dari Tatar Sunda”** ("A Shared Smile, A Voice from the Sundanese Land"), their reciprocal pantun performance captivated the judges and audience alike. The presentation not only showcased literary skill but also expressed strong cultural identity and the values of the Nusantara. The event itself was part of an effort by the Southeast Asian Literary Council (Mastera) and the Indonesian Ministry of Education to strengthen regional cultural ties through pantun as a shared heritage.

The FPBS UPI team consisted of four students: **Rohmat, Nayla Yuliandri, Fadilla Putri Madani, and Zacky Fajar Pratama**, accompanied by two faculty mentors: **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta** and **Dr. Halimah, M.Pd.** In addition to competing, they also participated in a seminar and pantun workshop alongside participants from Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei Darussalam.

In the seminar session, **Prof. Dr. Yulianeta** presented a paper titled *“Pantun as Cultural Diplomacy: A Shared Voice in the Frame of Oral Literature.”* She emphasized pantun as a meaningful form of cultural communication in building cross-national networks. Meanwhile, **Dr. Halimah** highlighted the educational value of pantun, rich in moral messages and instrumental in shaping the character of younger generations.

Each student shared meaningful reflections from the experience:
- **Rohmat** described it as an unforgettable academic journey that deepened his love for national culture.  
- **Nayla** expressed a deeper understanding of pantun’s essence and its philosophical layers behind poetic lines.  
- **Fadilla** felt honored to represent Indonesia on an international stage and to convey noble cultural values through pantun.  
- **Zacky** saw pantun as a simple yet profound medium of communication that deserves to be revived by the younger generation.

One of the pantun verses presented by the UPI team read:

> *Elok sulaman baju kebaya*  
> *Dibawa singgah ke negeri jiran*  
> *Pantun warisan adat budaya*  
> *Ragam petuah dalam hiburan*  

Dean of FPBS UPI, **Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd.**, stated that this achievement reflects the faculty's commitment to advancing internationalization while remaining rooted in local cultural heritage.

The success of FPBS UPI at this event reinforces the idea that pantun is not merely a relic of the past, but a bridge to the future—strengthening shared identity and unity across Southeast Asia.
