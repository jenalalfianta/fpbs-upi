Lampung, October 23–25, 2025 — The Master’s and Doctoral Programs of Indonesian Language Education, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), held a Joint Lecture and Workshop on Outcome Based Education (OBE) Curriculum at the University of Lampung. The activity carried two main themes: “Why and How to Engage with Literature” and “Literature-Based Educational Research.”

Held over three days, the event served as a platform for exchanging ideas among lecturers, postgraduate students, and education practitioners to deepen their understanding of literature as a foundation for curriculum development and research. Through this activity, participants explored creative literary engagement strategies while connecting them to value-based research development in the context of Indonesian language learning in the digital era.

The Head of the Indonesian Language Education Study Program, Prof. Dr. Sumiyadi, M.Hum., stated that this activity is a continuation of the implementation of the OBE-based curriculum currently applied within FPBS UPI. 

> “Through this joint lecture and workshop, we aim to provide a more practical understanding of how learning outcomes are integrated with research and literary practice,” he said.

In addition to lectures and workshops, the program included group discussions and collaborative reflections among participants from UPI and the University of Lampung (UNILA).

This activity also supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly **SDG 4: Quality Education**, by strengthening the capacity of lecturers and postgraduate students in learning innovation, and **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals**, by fostering academic synergy between universities.

By conducting this activity, PBSI FPBS UPI reaffirms its commitment to developing literature-based curricula and research oriented toward learning outcomes, relevant to contemporary educational needs, and aligned with the global agenda for sustainable education.
