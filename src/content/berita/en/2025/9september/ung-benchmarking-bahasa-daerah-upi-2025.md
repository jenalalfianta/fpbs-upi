**Bandung, September 22, 2025** – The Sundanese Language Education Study Program at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) once again demonstrated its role as a reference center for regional language preservation. With extensive experience in curriculum management, linguistic research, and community service, the program has become a strategic partner for other universities in Indonesia.  

This role was further affirmed when UPI hosted a benchmarking visit from the **Center for the Preservation of Regional Language and Literature Studies, Gorontalo State University (UNG),** on Monday, September 22, 2025. The event served as a platform for knowledge exchange and critical reflection on how UPI has successfully developed a competitive regional language program.  

In his remarks at 09:21 AM, **Dr. Haris Santosa, M.Pd.,** representing UPI, emphasized that establishing a regional language study program is not merely an academic step but also a cultural and social responsibility. He praised UNG’s initiative to open new opportunities for preserving local languages through formal education.  

Meanwhile, at 09:10 AM, **Prof. Dr. Sulaeman Bouti, S.Pd., M.Hum.,** representing UNG, conveyed the purpose of the benchmarking visit. He stated that UNG currently does not have a study program specifically dedicated to regional language studies. According to him, the establishment of the Gorontalo Regional Language Program is crucial to addressing the challenges of local language preservation and strengthening the cultural identity of the Gorontalo community.  

The discussion continued at 09:28 AM with an in-depth interview session. One of the main points raised was the initial strategy of developing the program through comparative research between the Gorontalo and Sundanese languages. This approach is considered essential for UNG to build a strong academic foundation before submitting the proposal for the program to the relevant ministry.  

The plan to establish this program was positively received, as it would be the first in Gorontalo dedicated specifically to regional language studies. Its presence is expected to open opportunities for Gorontalo’s younger generation to learn, research, and preserve their mother tongue through formal education.  

Furthermore, the program is seen as a way to strengthen the role of universities in sustaining local cultural heritage. More broadly, the establishment of the Regional Language Education Program at UNG will be a tangible contribution to national efforts to safeguard Indonesia’s linguistic diversity, which faces challenges from globalization.  

The benchmarking activity at UPI marked an important milestone, not only as a platform for knowledge sharing but also as an initial step toward the establishment of the long-awaited program. It is hoped that the program will soon be realized and contribute to preserving Gorontalo’s linguistic and cultural identity in the future.  

This initiative aligns with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),** particularly Goal 4 (*Quality Education*) and Goal 11 (*Sustainable Cities and Communities*), especially target 11.4 which emphasizes the protection of cultural heritage. Thus, regional language preservation is positioned not only as an academic field but also as part of sustainable development that safeguards national diversity.
