Surabaya, November 4, 2025 - The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) conducted an academic visit to the Faculty of Languages and Arts (FBS) at Universitas Negeri Surabaya (UNESA) to explore strategic collaboration and initiate the establishment of a Mandarin Language Study Program within FPBS UPI. This initiative responds to the growing demand for Mandarin proficiency in academia, industry, and global relations.  

Representing FPBS UPI, the visit was attended by Prof. Dr. Yulianeta, M.Pd., Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Quality Assurance. She was warmly welcomed by the Dean of FBS UNESA, Syafi’ul Anam, Ph.D., accompanied by Prof. Anas Ahmadi, S.Pd., M.Pd., as well as the Coordinator of the Mandarin Language Education Study Program, Miftachul Amri, S.Pd., M.Pd., M.Ed., Ph.D., along with the Quality Assurance Team of the Mandarin Language Education Study Program at UNESA.  

In his remarks, the Coordinator of the Mandarin Language Education Study Program at UNESA expressed appreciation for FPBS UPI’s initiative to strengthen academic partnerships in foreign language education. He emphasized UNESA’s readiness to share best practices, particularly in study program management, culture-based curriculum design, innovative teaching approaches, and the development of international collaboration networks with partner universities in China.  

Echoing this, Prof. Dr. Yulianeta stated that the plan to establish a Mandarin Language Study Program at FPBS UPI is a vital step toward expanding UPI’s multilingual education ecosystem.  
> “This initiative is not only about strengthening academic programs but also about UPI’s commitment to preparing graduates who are adaptive, globally minded, and competent in cross-cultural communication,” she explained.  

The meeting was highly productive, covering key topics such as curriculum design, quality assurance systems, study program governance, culture-based learning models, opportunities for collaborative research, and potential faculty and student exchange programs.  

As an initial form of collaboration, the two faculties signed a cooperation document, formally received by the Coordinator of the Mandarin Language Education Study Program at UNESA together with the Quality Assurance Team, serving as key academic partners who will support the initiation and planning process of the Mandarin Language Study Program at FPBS UPI.  

Both faculties agreed to follow up on this meeting by drafting a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), encompassing academic activities, joint research, and community service programs in the field of language and culture.  

This visit marks an important milestone for FPBS UPI in strengthening national academic collaboration and preparing for the establishment of a Mandarin Language Study Program that is excellent, adaptive, and globally competitive — aligned with UPI’s vision as a pioneering and leading university in multilingual and multicultural education at the global level.
