The UPI Laboratory High School, in collaboration with the Indonesian Language and Literature Education Study Program (PBSI) of FPBS UPI, successfully organized a *“Public Speaking Workshop and Training”* held from June 16–19, 2025. The activity was conducted during the semester break and was attended by 60 selected students with strong interest and enthusiasm in improving their speaking skills.  

Over four days, participants received comprehensive training, covering the following aspects:  

1. **Effective Speaking Tips** – vocal techniques, expression, and body language.  
2. **Steps to Compose a Speech Text** – structuring ideas, choosing appropriate language, and building speech flow.  
3. **Speaking Practice through TikTok** – utilizing digital platforms to practice self-expression and delivering short, clear, and engaging speeches.  
4. **Reflection** – self-evaluation and experience-sharing sessions to strengthen students’ self-confidence.  

This program aimed to equip students with essential public communication skills needed in modern times, whether in academic, organizational, or professional contexts. The Principal of UPI Laboratory High School emphasized that the training not only improved speaking skills but also fostered students’ confidence, creativity, and digital literacy.  

By the end of the training on June 19, 2025, participants were expected to apply their speaking skills in various contexts, both in school and in the wider community. This workshop serves as concrete evidence of UPI Laboratory High School’s commitment to preparing a young generation that is bold, confident, and adaptive to technological developments.
