Bandung, November 17, 2025 — Students of the Japanese Language Education Study Program from the Sakura Taishougoto division (Department of Talent and Interest Development of the Japanese Language Student Association, UPI) carried out a community service activity titled AMITABA (Ayo Main Taishougoto Bareng). The activity took place on Monday, November 17, 2025, at the Japan Corner and the 3rd-floor classrooms of FPBS UPI.

This session welcomed special young guests from SD Tunas Insan Mulia, whose Japanese Language extracurricular program routinely conducts educational visits. During the visit, the students explored the Japan Corner to learn more about various aspects of Japanese culture.

The activity was also accompanied by Wildan Ahmad Firdaus, an alumnus of the Japanese Language Education Study Program (class of 2009), who now serves as a homeroom teacher at the school.

Through this activity, PBJ UPI students practiced teaching while introducing and preserving Japanese culture, particularly through the traditional musical instrument *Taishougoto*. The program provided valuable insights and new experiences for both the university students and the visiting elementary school students.
