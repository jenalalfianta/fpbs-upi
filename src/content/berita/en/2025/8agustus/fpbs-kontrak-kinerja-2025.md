**Bandung, August 29, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), reinforced its academic leadership commitment by signing the performance contract and declaration of commitment for structural officials for the 2025–2030 term. The ceremony, held at the UPI Partere Building on Friday (29/8/2025) at 14.00 WIB, was attended by the Dean, vice deans, heads of study programs, all FPBS structural officials, and other university leaders.  

The event began with an opening, the recitation of verses from the Qur’an, and an activity report by the Vice Rector for Resources and General Affairs, **Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd.** Afterwards, the Rector of UPI, **Prof. Dr. Didi Sukyadi, M.A.**, delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of leadership consolidation and governance with integrity. The ceremony continued with the symbolic signing of the performance contract by the deans and directors, and concluded with a joint prayer and photo session.  

This performance contract was drafted based on UPI’s Strategic Plan (Renstra) and serves as a guideline for each unit to design work programs and achieve performance targets. Through this signing, all leaders committed to driving their respective units to work in alignment, with measurable outcomes, and oriented toward institutional goals.  

In his remarks, the Dean of FPBS UPI stated that the performance contract is not merely an administrative document but also a moral and professional commitment. *“At FPBS, we are committed to supporting UPI’s vision of becoming a world-class university by improving the quality of education, research, and community service in language and literature. This contract serves as a reminder for all leaders to work more collaboratively, transparently, and with integrity in steering the faculty toward greater excellence,”* he said.  

The signing also marked the conclusion of the **Leadership and National Defense Retreat** held on August 27–29, 2025, at Dodik Rindam III/Siliwangi, Lembang. The retreat reinforced values of loyalty, integrity, nationalism, and patriotism, which serve as a strong foundation for academic leadership at UPI.  

Through this momentum, FPBS reaffirmed its commitment to supporting **SDG 4 (Quality Education)** by enhancing academic and research quality, while also realizing **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)** through transparent, accountable, and performance-oriented faculty governance. With this step, the FPBS leadership for the 2025–2030 term is expected to be more solid and ready to lead the faculty toward becoming an excellent, innovative, and globally relevant institution.
