**Bandung, September 16, 2025** — Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), through the Arabic Language Education Study Program, Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), officially established a strategic partnership with SD Pintar, located at Jl. Abadi IV No.1, Gegerkalong, Sukasari District, Bandung City, to strengthen the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on Quality Education.  

The signing of the Implementation Agreement and Cooperation Agreement was carried out by the Head of SD Pintar, **Rini Ramdhany, S.Pd.,** and the Dean of FPBS UPI, **Wawan Gunawan, M.Ed., Ph.D.,** on Monday (16/9). The signing was conducted separately but directly observed by students of the Arabic Language Education Study Program, FPBS UPI.  

This collaboration resulted in the launch of the **Teacher Professional Experience Enhancement Program (P3K)** at SD Pintar. The program is designed as an experiential learning platform for students. For one semester, or four months in the 2025/2026 academic year, students will be actively involved in teaching, administrative management, and the development of professional competencies in the elementary school environment.  

According to the Arabic Language Education Study Program of FPBS UPI, this collaboration is part of the implementation of the **Tri Dharma of Higher Education**—education, research, and community service—while also fostering a synergistic relationship between higher education institutions and elementary schools.  

*“This program is expected to serve as a model for strengthening the link and match between universities and schools. SD Pintar will become a field laboratory for students to apply theory in real practice,”* said **Wawan Gunawan** after the signing.  

With this program, both UPI and SD Pintar are optimistic about making a significant contribution to improving the quality of national elementary education. This joint step is believed to support the achievement of **SDG 4**, particularly in ensuring equal learning opportunities and strengthening the competencies of teaching staff starting from the elementary level.  

In addition to expanding partnership networks, this collaboration is also projected to enrich the learning experiences of FPBS UPI students while bringing positive impacts to SD Pintar as a partner for professional practice.
