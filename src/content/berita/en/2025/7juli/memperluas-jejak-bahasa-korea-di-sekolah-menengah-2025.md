**Bandung, July 24, 2025** – On this special date, UPI in collaboration with AJARI and the Korean Education Center Indonesia (KECI) held a national seminar titled: *“Promoting Korean Language Education at Indonesian Secondary Schools: Strategies and Approaches”* (인도네시아 중등교육기관에서의 한국어 보급 확산 방안).

Held in a hybrid format at the FPBS UPI Auditorium B, the event attracted attention from many groups, including Korean language teachers, school principals, lecturers, students, and the general public concerned about the future of foreign language education—especially Korean—in Indonesia.

The seminar was officially opened by **Prof. Dr. H. Didi Sukyadi, M.A.**, Rector of UPI, who in his remarks emphasized the importance of international synergy in building the quality of multilingual education. Echoing this, **Prof. Dr. Tri Indri Hardini, M.Pd.**, Dean of FPBS UPI, stated that FPBS is always committed to fostering innovation in language learning, including through collaborative forums such as this seminar.

Adding symbolic strength to the event, **Mr. Park Soo-deok**, *Chargé d'Affaires ad interim* of the Embassy of the Republic of Korea to Indonesia, **Mr. Kim Kyu Nyun**, Director of KECI, and **Mr. Choi Hyun Soo**, Director of the Korea Foundation (KF) Jakarta Office, were also in attendance. They expressed appreciation for Indonesia's concrete efforts to support the expansion of Korean language education at the secondary school level.

The seminar served as a scientific dialogue forum that brought together experts and practitioners from both countries. **Dr. Laksmi Dewi, M.Pd.**, representing **Prof. Toni Toharudin, S.Si., M.Sc.**, delivered a keynote speech on behalf of the Head of Curriculum and Learning Center, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Indonesia (Kemendikbudristek RI). She presented key strategies for integrating Korean language into the national secondary school curriculum.

From South Korea, **Prof. Kang Nam Wook** of Sungkyunkwan University and representative of the *K-Teacher* program shared best practices on how Korea is globally expanding its language education system. His presentation highlighted that Korea is exporting not only pop culture but also a structured and standardized language education system.

The seminar continued with speakers from Indonesia: **Ranti Eka Pratiwi, S.Hum.**, discussed the development of Korean language teaching approaches in Indonesian high schools. Also featured were **Ashanti Widyana, M.A.**, and **Jayanti Megasari, M.A.**, who presented the core and supplementary textbooks used by Korean language teachers at the senior secondary level in Indonesia.
