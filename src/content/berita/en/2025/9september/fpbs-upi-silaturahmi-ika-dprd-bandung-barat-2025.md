**West Bandung Regency, September 30, 2025** – The Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), paid a courtesy visit to the **Chairman of the FPBS Alumni Association (IKA FPBS)** at the **West Bandung Regency Regional House of Representatives (DPRD)**.  

An active and synergistic alumni association plays a vital role in institutional development. The FPBS UPI Alumni Association (IKA) for the 2021–2026 term has consistently contributed to various academic and student initiatives—providing input for curriculum and teaching development, serving as guest speakers in academic events, and supporting student programs.  

To further strengthen this collaboration, two FPBS Vice Deans—**Prof. Dr. Zaka Alfarisi, M.Hum.** (Vice Dean for Finance, Resources, and General Affairs) and **Yanty Wirza, M.Pd., M.A., Ph.D.** (Vice Dean for Student Affairs and Partnerships)—accompanied by representatives of the **FPBS Student Association (Kema FPBS),** **Legio Rivahel Bonatua Sitanggang** and **Salwa Fadhillah Fitriani,** visited **Rismanto, S.Pd., M.Ikom.,** Chairman of IKA FPBS and Member of Commission 1 as well as Chairman of the PKS Faction at the West Bandung Regency DPRD.  

The visit, held on **Tuesday, September 30, 2025,** was also attended by **Dadang A. Sapardan, M.Pd.,** an FPBS alumnus currently serving as **Acting Head of the West Bandung Regency Education Office.** The meeting discussed the strategic role of IKA FPBS in advancing the faculty, particularly in supporting student programs, internship opportunities, alumni recruitment, and the **UPI Green Metric program.**  

This activity aligns closely with **SDG 4 (Quality Education)** as collaboration among the faculty, students, and alumni creates opportunities to enhance learning quality. Through alumni contributions as mentors, internship supervisors, and job providers, students gain contextual and industry-relevant learning experiences.  

Additionally, the role of IKA FPBS supports **SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)** by facilitating alumni recruitment channels and internship opportunities, strengthening students’ transition into the workforce. With a robust alumni network, the educational ecosystem extends beyond academics to include skill development and graduate competitiveness.  

Furthermore, IKA FPBS’s support for the **UPI Green Metric program** contributes to **SDG 13 (Climate Action)** and **SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).** Alumni involvement in green campus initiatives reflects a shared commitment to creating a sustainable learning environment. Cross-stakeholder collaboration—among the faculty, students, alumni, and government institutions—is expected to foster strategic synergy that advances academic excellence while contributing to the global sustainable development agenda.
