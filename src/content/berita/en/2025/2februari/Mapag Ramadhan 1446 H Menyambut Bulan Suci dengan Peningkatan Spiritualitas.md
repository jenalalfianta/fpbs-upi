In preparation for the holy month of Ramadan 1446 H, the Faculty of Language and Literature Education (FPBS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia held a **"Mapag Ramadan"** event on Wednesday, 26 February 2025. The event was attended by lecturers, administrative staff, and cleaning service personnel within the FPBS community.

The event began with an opening by the Master of Ceremony (MC), followed by welcoming remarks from the Dean of FPBS, who emphasized the importance of Ramadan as a time for self-reflection and spiritual growth.

The highlight of the event was a religious sermon delivered by **Ustad Akbar Nazary Muhammad, M.Ed., Ph.D.** In his sermon, he encouraged all attendees to use the month of Ramadan as a moment to increase worship and enhance personal development.

“Ramadan urges us to engage in more positive activities and draw closer to Allah. By the end of Ramadan, we should emerge as better individuals. Just like a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, Ramadan should bring about a personal transformation,” said Ustad Akbar in his sermon.

Following the sermon, the event continued with a social gathering session to strengthen camaraderie among the FPBS community. The program concluded with the traditional **“munggahan”**—a communal meal shared as a form of gratitude in welcoming the blessed month.

Through the **Mapag Ramadan** event, it is hoped that all members of the FPBS academic community can welcome the holy month with spiritual awareness and open hearts. May this Ramadan be a meaningful moment for each individual to become better—both spiritually and socially. **(Teja Mustika)**
